  {"id":"A1998","abstract":"Weak-acid preservatives are widely used to maintain microbial stability in foods and beverages. Classical weak-acid theory proposes that undissociated acid molecules pass through the plasma membrane, dissociate in the neutral pH of the cytoplasm, release protons and inhibit growth through acidification of the cytoplasm. Inhibitory concentrations of sorbic acid are shown to liberate fewer protons than other weak-acid preservatives. Sorbic acid shows similar inhibition to other six-carbon acids, alcohols and aldehydes, the latter being unable to act as weak acids. A survey of 22 yeasts showed high correlation between sorbate resistance and ethanol tolerance. Inhibition by short-chain acids or alcohols showed strong correlation with lipophilicity. It is proposed that sorbic acid acts as a membrane-active substance rather than as a weak-acid preservative.","author":[{"family":"Stratford","given":"M."},{"family":"Anslow","given":"P.A."}],"citation-key":"A1998","container-title":"Letters in Applied Microbiology","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"page":"203-206","title":"Evidence that sorbic acid does not inhibit yeast as a classic 'weak acid preservative'.","type":"article-journal","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"ADAM","abstract":"Dietary calcined magnesite supplements of different particle sizes and temperatures of calcination were examined at Glasgow University Veterinary School in 1981. Balance experiments with wether sheep revealed that particle sizes < 75, 75-150, 150-250 and 500-1000 μm diameter of a feed-grade calcined magnesite all increased urinary output of magnesium to a similar extent but the apparent magnesium availability coefficient for the 500-1000 μm diameter fraction (0.03) was significantly less than for fractions of smaller diameter (0.17-0.23) (P < 0.01). A 1000-2000 μm fraction of fertilizer-grade material had an apparent availability of 0.18 but had the least effect on urinary magnesium output. Calcination temperatures of 800, 900 and 1100 °C significantly increased apparent availability (c. 0.46) compared with that for temperatures of 500 and 650 °C (c. 0.12) (P < 0.01), and significantly increased urinary output of magnesium. Losses of magnesium from these supplements incubated in the rumen of cows at grass in 24 μm mesh nylon bags showed some correlations with their apparent availability and urinary magnesium output. Solubility in molar ammonium nitrate showed some good correlations with urinary magnesium output but not with magnesium availability. Supplementation of a low magnesium diet given to lactating ewes with fine particle ( < 75μm) calcined magnesite resulted in significantly greater increases in plasma magnesium concentration than when coarse particle material (500-1000 μm) was given (P < 0.05), but magnesites calcined at 650 and 800 °C induced similar changes in plasma magnesium.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",5,29]]},"author":[{"family":"ADAM","given":"C.

  {"id":"Adediran2012","abstract":"Fourteen lactation models were fitted to average and individual cow lactation data from pasture-based dairy systems in the Australian states of Victoria and Tasmania. The models included a new \"log-quadratic\" model, and a major objective was to evaluate and compare the performance of this model with the other models. Nine empirical and 5 mechanistic models were first fitted to average test-day milk yield of Holstein-Friesian dairy cows using the nonlinear procedure in SAS. Two additional semiparametric models were fitted using a linear model in ASReml. To investigate the influence of days to first test-day and the number of test-days, 5 of the best-fitting models were then fitted to individual cow lactation data. Model goodness of fit was evaluated using criteria such as the residual mean square, the distribution of residuals, the correlation between actual and predicted values, and the Wald-Wolfowitz runs test. Goodness of fit was similar in all but one of the models in terms of fitting average lactation but they differed in their ability to predict individual lactations. In particular, the widely used incomplete gamma model most displayed this failing. The new log-quadratic model was robust in fitting average and individual lactations, and was less affected by sampled data and more parsimonious in having only 3 parameters, each of which lends itself to biological interpretation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Adediran","given":"S","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Ratkowsky","given":"D","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Donaghy","given":"D J"},{"family":"Malau-Aduli","given":"a E O"}],"citation-key":"Adediran2012","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2011-4663","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",9]]},"page":"5344-56","PMID":"22916941","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Comparative evaluation of a new lactation curve model for pasture-based Holstein-Friesian dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22916941","volume":"95"},
  {"id":"adeniyi2024","abstract":"The problem of copper (Cu) intoxication and deficiency continues to impact economic gains and animal welfare in sheep husbandry. This study investigated the ovine genome for regions and potential genes under selection for Cu accretion between sheep breeds. For this, we compared ovine single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data of three Cu-susceptible breeds with three Cu-tolerant breeds. After merging SNP data of breeds and removal of related individuals, a total of 229 sheep and 45 640 autosomal SNPs were left. Then, we selected 14 individuals per breed into two datasets (datasets 1 and 2) for analysis of selection signatures using the Fixation index, cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity and haplotype-based FLK methods. Selection regions shared by both datasets detected by at least two methods revealed regions on OAR 4, 8 and 11 containing 54 candidate genes under selection for Cu accretion. Enrichment analysis revealed that 19 gene ontologies and 1 enriched Kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes pathway terms were associated with the candidate genes under selection. Genes such as TP53, TNFSF13, TNFSF12, ALOX15, ALOX12, EIF5A and PREP are associated with the regulation of Cu homeostasis, programmed cell death or inflammatory response. We also found an enrichment of arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase activity, arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase activity and ferroptosis that influence cellular inflammation and cell death. These results shed light on ovine genomic regions under selection for Cu accretion and provide information on candidate genes for further studies on breed differences in ovine Cu accretion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Adeniyi","given":"O.

  {"id":"Aguilar2010","abstract":"The first national single-step, full-information (phenotype, pedigree, and marker genotype) genetic evaluation was developed for final score of US Holsteins. Data included final scores recorded from 1955 to 2009 for 6,232,548 Holsteins cows. BovineSNP50 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) genotypes from the Cooperative Dairy DNA Repository (Beltsville, MD) were available for 6,508 bulls. Three analyses used a repeatability animal model as currently used for the national US evaluation. The first 2 analyses used final scores recorded up to 2004. The first analysis used only a pedigree-based relationship matrix. The second analysis used a relationship matrix based on both pedigree and genomic information (single-step approach). The third analysis used the complete data set and only the pedigree-based relationship matrix. The fourth analysis used predictions from the first analysis (final scores up to 2004 and only a pedigree-based relationship matrix) and prediction using a genomic based matrix to obtain genetic evaluation (multiple-step approach). Different allele frequencies were tested in construction of the genomic relationship matrix. Coefficients of determination between predictions of young bulls from parent average, single-step, and multiple-step approaches and their 2009 daughter deviations were 0.24, 0.37 to 0.41, and 0.40, respectively. The highest coefficient of determination for a single-step approach was observed when using a genomic relationship matrix with assumed allele frequencies of 0.5. Coefficients for regression of 2009 daughter deviations on parent-average, single-step, and multiple-step predictions were 0.76, 0.68 to 0.79, and 0.86, respectively, which indicated some inflation of predictions. The single-step regression coefficient could be increased up to 0.92 by scaling differences between the genomic and pedigree-based relationship matrices with little loss in accuracy of prediction. One complete evaluation took about 2h of computing time and 2.7 gigabytes of memory. Computing times for single-step analyses were slightly longer (2%) than for pedigree-based analysis. A national single-step genetic evaluation with the pedigree relationship matrix augmented with genomic information provided genomic predictions with accuracy and bias comparable to multiple-step procedures and could account for any population or data structure. Advantages of single-step evaluations should increase in the future when animals are pre-selected on genotypes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Aguilar","given":"I"},{"family":"Misztal","given":"I"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"D L"},{"family":"Legarra","given":"a"},{"family":"Tsuruta","given":"S"},{"family":"Lawlor","given":"T J"}],"citation-key":"Aguilar2010","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2009-2730","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",2]]},"page":"743-52","PMID":"20105546","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Hot topic: a unified approach to utilize phenotypic, full pedigree, and genomic information for genetic evaluation of Holstein final score.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20105546","volume":"93"},
  {"id":"Aguilar2012","abstract":"Milk urea nitrogen (MUN) is correlated with N balance, N intake, and dietary N content, and thus is a good indicator of proper feeding management with respect to protein. It is commonly used to monitor feeding programs to achieve environmental goals; however, genetic diversity also exists among cows. It was hypothesized that phenotypic diversity among cows could bias feed management decisions when monitoring tools do not consider genetic diversity associated with MUN. The objective of the work was to evaluate the effect of cow and herd variation on MUN. Data from 2 previously published research trials and a field trial were subjected to multivariate regression analyses using a mixed model. Analyses of the research trial data showed that MUN concentrations could be predicted equally well from diet composition, milk yield, and milk components regardless of whether dry matter intake was included in the regression model. This indicated that cow and herd variation could be accurately estimated from field trial data when feed intake was not known. Milk urea N was correlated with dietary protein and neutral detergent fiber content, milk yield, milk protein content, and days in milk for both data sets. Cow was a highly significant determinant of MUN regardless of the data set used, and herd trended to significance for the field trial data. When all other variables were held constant, a percentage unit change in dietary protein concentration resulted in a 1.1mg/dL change in MUN. Least squares means estimates of MUN concentrations across herds ranged from a low of 13.6mg/dL to a high of 17.3mg/dL. If the observed MUN for the high herd were caused solely by high crude protein feeding, then the herd would have to reduce dietary protein to a concentration of 12.8% of dry matter to achieve a MUN concentration of 12mg/dL, likely resulting in lost milk production. If the observed phenotypic variation is due to genetic differences among cows, genetic choices could result in herds that exceed target values for MUN when adhering to best management practices, which is consistent with the trend for differences in MUN among herds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Aguilar","given":"M"},{"family":"Hanigan","given":"M D"},{"family":"Tucker","given":"H","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Jones","given":"B L"},{"family":"Garbade","given":"S K"},{"family":"McGilliard","given":"M L"},{"family":"Stallings","given":"C C"},{"family":"Knowlton","given":"K F"},{"family":"James","given":"R E"}],"citation-key":"Aguilar2012","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5582","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",12]]},"page":"7261-8","PMID":"23040023","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Cow and herd variation in milk urea nitrogen concentrations in lactating dairy cattle.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23040023","volume":"95"},

Most of the studied parameters changed similarly to what has been described in experimentally induced endotoxaemia.

The changes of these parameters were also closely related to each other. Furthermore, the changes were more pronounced in paretic cows.

  {"id":"Akins2014","abstract":"The objective of this study was to determine the effects of monensin (M) supplementation on lactation performance of dairy cows fed diets of either reduced (RS) or normal (NS) starch concentrations as total mixed rations. One hundred twenty-eight Holstein and Holstein × Jersey cows (90±33 d in milk) were stratified by breed and parity and randomly assigned to 16 pens of 8 cows each in a randomized controlled trial. Pens were then randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. A 4-wk covariate adjustment period preceded the treatment period, with all pens receiving NS supplemented with 18g of monensin/t of dry matter (DM). Following the 4-wk covariate adjustment period, cows were fed their assigned treatment diets of NS with M (18g of monensin/t), NS with 0g of monensin/t (C), RS with M, or RS with C for 12 wk. Actual starch concentrations for the RS and NS diets were 20.4 and 26.9% (DM basis), respectively. Mean dry matter intake (DMI; 27.0kg/d) was unaffected by the treatments. Feeding M compared with C and NS compared with RS increased milk yield by 1.3 and 1.5kg/d per cow, respectively. Milk protein percentage and yield and lactose yield were increased and milk urea nitrogen was decreased for NS compared with RS. Feeding M increased actual and component-corrected milk feed efficiencies (component-corrected milk yield/DMI) and lactose yield and tended to increase milk urea nitrogen compared with C. Milk protein percentage was decreased for M compared with C, but milk fat percentage and yield, protein yield, and lactose percentage were unaffected by M. We observed a tendency for a starch × monensin interaction for milk feed efficiency (actual milk yield/DMI); M tended to increase efficiency more for NS than for RS. Starch and monensin had minimal effects on milk fatty acid composition and yields. Feeding RS decreased milk and protein yields, but component-corrected milk yields and feed efficiencies were similar for RS and NS. Monensin increased feed efficiency and lactation performance for both dietary starch concentrations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Akins","given":"M S"},{"family":"Perfield","given":"K L"},{"family":"Green","given":"H B"},{"family":"Bertics","given":"S J"},{"family":"Shaver","given":"R D"}],"citation-key":"Akins2014","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2013-6756","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3]]},"page":"917-29","PMID":"24342685","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of monensin in lactating dairy cow diets at 2 starch concentrations.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24342685","volume":"97"},

  {"id":"Albers2007","abstract":"We present CVMHAPLO, a probabilistic method for haplotyping in general pedigrees with many markers. CVMHAPLO reconstructs the haplotypes by assigning in every iteration a fixed number of the ordered genotypes with the highest marginal probability, conditioned on the marker data and ordered genotypes assigned in previous iterations. CVMHAPLO makes use of the cluster variation method (CVM) to efficiently estimate the marginal probabilities. We focused on single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in the evaluation of our approach. In simulated data sets where exact computation was feasible, we found that the accuracy of CVMHAPLO was high and similar to that of maximum-likelihood methods. In simulated data sets where exact computation of the maximum-likelihood haplotype configuration was not feasible, the accuracy of CVMHAPLO was similar to that of state of the art Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) maximum-likelihood approximations when all ordered genotypes were assigned and higher when only a subset of the ordered genotypes was assigned. CVMHAPLO was faster than the MCMC approach and provided more detailed information about the uncertainty in the inferred haplotypes. We conclude that CVMHAPLO is a practical tool for the inference of haplotypes in large complex pedigrees.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Albers","given":"Cornelis","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Heskes","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Kappen","given":"Hilbert J"}],"citation-key":"Albers2007","container-title":"Genetics","DOI":"10.1534/genetics.107.074047","ISBN":"3124361423","ISSN":"0016-6731","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",10]]},"page":"1101-16","PMID":"17660564","title":"Haplotype inference in general pedigrees using the cluster variation method.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2034616&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","volume":"177"},

  {"id":"albornozHighlyFermentableStarch2018","abstract":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of diet starch concentration and fermentability (SF) fed during the early postpartum (PP) period on dry matter intake (DMI), yields of milk and milk components, body reserves, and metabolism. Fifty-two multiparous Holstein cows were used in a randomized block design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Treatment diets were formulated to 22% (LS) or 28% (HS) starch with dry ground corn (DGC) or high-moisture corn (HMC) as the primary starch source. Treatments were fed from 1 to 23 d PP and cows were switched to a common diet until 72 d PP to measure carryover (CO) effects. Treatment period (TP) diets were formulated for 22% forage neutral detergent fiber and 17% crude protein, and starch concentration was adjusted by substitution of corn grain for soyhulls. Throughout the experiment DMI and milk yield were measured daily, and milk components, body condition score (BCS), and body weight were measured weekly. Blood was collected weekly during the TP and every second week during the CO period. During the TP, HMC decreased DMI more when included in the HS (3.9 kg/d) than in the LS (0.9 kg/d) diets and HMC decreased yields of milk, fat, and FCM by 4.3, 0.19, and 4.8 kg/d, respectively. Treatments also interacted over time to decrease DMI and yields of milk and milk components more for HMC compared with DGC as time progressed during the TP. Loss of BCS was increased when HMC was fed in a HS diet (-0.38 vs. -0.17) and decreased when included in a LS diet (-0.21 vs. -0.29) with no effects on body weight change during the TP. Treatments interacted with time to affect plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin with HS increasing concentrations early in the TP compared with LS but with similar effects by the end of the TP. During the CO period, treatment effects on DMI diminished over time with no main effects of treatment for the entire period. Starch concentration and SF interacted to affect yields of milk, fat, and FCM during the CO period, which were greater for HS-DGC and LS-HMC (54.8 and 52.8, 1.76 and 1.81, and 51.3 and 52.2 kg/d, respectively) than for LS-DGC and HS-HMC (51.2 and 51.0, 1.68 and 1.64, and 48.4 and 48.6 kg/d, respectively). Treatments did not affect BCS change during the CO period but HS lost body weight compared with LS (-5.7 vs. 7.0 kg). Blood glucose and insulin concentrations were not affected by treatments during the CO period. Feeding a highly fermentable starch source during the early PP period decreased DMI and yields of milk and milk components compared with a less fermentable starch source and the depression in DMI was greater when fed in the higher starch diet. However, diet starch concentration had no effects on yield of milk or milk components.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Albornoz","given":"Rodrigo I"},{"family":"Allen","given":"Michael S"}],"citation-key":"albornozHighlyFermentableStarch2018","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2018-14843","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,1]]},"page":"8902-8915","PMID":"30077453","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Highly fermentable starch at different diet starch concentrations decreased feed intake and milk yield of cows in the early postpartum period.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30077453","volume":"101"},

  {"id":"alomari2021","abstract":"The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria causing neonatal diarrhea in calves has become a serious problem in the control of infection. Due to increasing antibiotic resistance, bacteriophages with probiotics are considered the best alternative. The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of a suppository containing probiotic strains of Lactobacillus spp. and bacteriophages specific for pathogenic E. coli in young calves with diarrhea. The study evaluated therapeutic and prophylactic effects (specific and nonspecific humoral response). The study was carried out on 24 female HF calves, aged 2 to 7 days and weighing from 35 to 46 kg. The calves were divided into four groups (n = 6) as follows: Group 1, healthy control that received no medicine; Group 2, positive control with diarrhea; Group 3, healthy calves that received medicine; Group 4, calves with diarrhea that received medicine. The animals received suppositories containing Lactobacillus spp. and bacteriophages specific for pathogenic E. coli for 5 days. On the first day, the calves received the suppositories twice-in the morning and 12 h later; subsequently they were administered once a day. The health status of the calves was observed for 11 days after the first application of suppositories. A protective and preventive effect of the experimental therapy was obtained in the research. The probiotic-phage suppositories reduced the duration of diarrhea in calves, completely eliminating it within 24-48 h after use. The therapy stimulated the activation of immune mechanisms in calves, which translated into an enhanced specific and nonspecific response and increased resistance to infection.","author":[{"family":"Alomari","given":"Mohammed Mijbas M."},{"family":"Dec","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Nowaczek","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Puchalski","given":"Andrzej"},{"family":"Wernicki","given":"Andrzej"},{"family":"Kowalski","given":"Cezary"},{"family":"Urban-Chmiel","given":"Renata"}],"citation-key":"alomari2021","container-title":"ACS infectious diseases","container-title-short":"ACS Infect Dis","DOI":"10.1021/acsinfecdis.1c00010","ISSN":"2373-8227","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,13]]},"language":"eng","page":"2093-2101","PMCID":"PMC8369487","PMID":"33818076","source":"PubMed","title":"Therapeutic and Prophylactic Effect of the Experimental Bacteriophage Treatment to Control Diarrhea Caused by E. coli in Newborn Calves","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"alvarezcastro2007","abstract":"Interaction between genes, or epistasis, is found to\nbe common and it is a key concept for understanding\nadaptation and evolution of natural populations,\nresponse to selection in breeding programs, and\ndetermination of complex disease. Currently, two\nindependent classes of models are used to study\nepistasis. Statistical models focus on maintaining\ndesired statistical properties for detection and\nestimation of genetic effects and for the\ndecomposition of genetic variance using average\neffects of allele substitutions in populations as\nparameters.

Here we provide\na new, general and unified model framework: the\nnatural and orthogonal interactions (NOIA)\nmodel. NOIA implements tools for transforming\ngenetic effects measured in one population to the\nones of other populations (e.g., between two\nexperimental designs for QTL) and parameters of\nstatistical and functional epistasis into each other\n(thus enabling us to obtain functional estimates of\nQTL), as demonstrated numerically. We develop\ngraphical interpretations of functional and\nstatistical models as regressions of the genotypic\nvalues on the gene content, which illustrates the\ndifference between the models--the constraint on the\nslope of the functional regression--and when the\nmodels are equivalent. Furthermore, we use our\ntheoretical foundations to conceptually clarify\nfunctional and statistical epistasis, discuss the\nadvantages of NOIA over previous theory, and stress\nthe importance of linking functional and statistical\nmodels.","author":[{"family":"Alvarez-Castro","given":"Jose M"},{"family":"Carlborg","given":"Örjan"}],"citation-key":"alvarezcastro2007","container-title":"Genetics","DOI":"10.1534/genetics.106.067348","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"page":"1151-1167","title":"A Unified Model for Functional and Statistical Epistasis and Its Application in Quantitative Trait Loci Analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/abstract/176/2/1151","volume":"176"},
  {"id":"AlZahal2014","abstract":"The objective of the study was to determine the effect of active dry Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ADSC) supplementation on dry matter intake, milk yield, milk components, ruminal pH, and microbial community during a dietary regimen that leads to subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA). Sixteen multiparous, rumen-cannulated lactating Holstein cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments that included ADSC (Biomate; AB Vista, Marlborough, UK; 8 × 10(10) cfu/head per day) or control. During wk 1 to 6, all cows received a high-forage (HF) diet (77:23, forage:concentrate). Cows were then abruptly switched during wk 7 to a high-grain (HG) diet (49:51, forage:concentrate) and remained on the HG until the end of wk 10. Feed intake and milk yields were recorded daily. Ruminal pH was recorded continuously using an indwelling system for 1 to 2 d per week during the pre-experimental phase, and wk 6, 7, and 10. Ruminal digesta samples were collected at the end of the experiment and analyzed for relative change in microbial communities using real-time quantitative PCR. Cows were considered to have SARA if the duration below pH 5.6 was ≥300 min/d. Ruminal pH during wk 6 (HF plateau) was not different across treatments (15 ± 46 min/d at pH <5.6). The dietary regimen successfully induced SARA during wk 7 (transition from HF to HG diet), and ruminal pH (551 ± 46 min/d at pH <5.6) was not different across treatments. However, cows receiving ADSC had an improved ruminal pH (122 ± 57 vs. 321 ± 53 min/d at pH <5.6) during wk 10 (HG plateau) compared with control. Additionally, cows receiving ADSC had a better dry matter intake (23.3 ± 0.66 vs. 21.6 ± 0.61 kg/d) and 4% fat-corrected milk yield (29.6 ± 1.2 vs. 26.5 ± 1.2 kg/d) than control cows during the HG phase (wk 8 to 10). During HG feeding, cows receiving ADSC had greater total volatile fatty acid and propionate concentrations (175 ± 7.5 vs. 154 ± 7.5 and 117 ± 6.1 vs. 94 ± 5.7 mM for ADSC and control, respectively) and lower acetate:propionate ratio (0.26 ± 0.5 vs. 0.36 ± 0.05 for ADSC and control, respectively). Microbial analyses conducted on samples collected during wk 10 showed that cows supplemented with S. cerevisiae had a 9-fold, 2-fold, 6-fold, 1.3-fold, and 8-fold increase in S. cerevisiae, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Anaerovibrio lipolytica, Ruminococcus albus, and anaerobic fungi, respectively, which suggested an increase in cellulolytic microbes within the rumen. Cows supplemented with ADSC had 2.2-fold reduction in Prevotella albensis, which is a gram-negative bacterium predominant during SARA. Prevotella spp. are suggested to be an important source of lipopolysaccharide responsible for inflammation within the rumen. Cows supplemented with ADSC had a 2.3-fold increase in Streptococcus bovis and a 12-fold reduction in Megasphaera elsdenii. The reduction in M. elsdenii may reflect lower concentration of lactic acid within the rumen for ADSC cows. In conclusion, ADSC supplementation to dairy cows was demonstrated to alleviate the condition of SARA caused by abrupt dietary changes from HF to HG, and can potentially improve rumen function, as indicated by greater numbers of cellulolytic microorganisms within the rumen.","author":[{"family":"AlZahal","given":"O"},{"family":"Dionissopoulos","given":"L"},{"family":"Laarman","given":"A H"},{"family":"Walker","given":"N"},{"family":"McBride","given":"B W"}],"citation-key":"AlZahal2014","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2014-8212","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"7751-63","PMID":"25282426","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Active dry Saccharomyces cerevisiae can alleviate the effect of subacute ruminal acidosis in lactating dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030214006687","volume":"97"},

Experimental diets were a control containing 27.4 % alfalfa silage, 22.5% corn silage, and 50.1% concentrate, and four diets with either tallow, raw soybean, extruded soybean, or roasted soybean added to provide 1.93% supplemental fat. Dry matter and NEL intakes were similar among treatments, while cows fed fat diets had significantly (P<0.05) high NEL intakes when compared to control with no fat. Supplemental fat, whether tallow or full fat soybeans increased milk production (1.89-2.45 kg/d; P<0.01) and FCM production (1.05-2.79; P<0.01). Milk fat yield and percentage of cows fed fat-supplemented diets were significantly (P<0.01 and P<0.05 respectively) higher than control. Between fat-supplemented diets, roasted soybean caused highest milk fat yield and extruded soybean caused lowest milk fat yield. There was no significant effect of supplemental fat on the milk protein and lactose content and yield. Feed efficiency of fat-supplemented diets was significantly (P<0.01) higher than control. Body weight, body weight change and BCS (body condition score) of cows, as well as energy balance and energy efficiency were similar between treatments. In conclusion, while there was no significant effect of fat sources on production response of cows, fat originating from heat-treated soybean help to minimize imported RUP (rumen undegradable protein) sources level as fish meal in comparison with tallow and raw soybean oil.

Treatments were control group without infusion (control; n = 190); 1 s.c. infusion of 250 mL of 40% Ca borogluconate (1SC250; n = 72) at calving; 1 s.c. infusion of 500 mL of 40% Ca borogluconate (1SC500; n = 63) at calving; 2 s.c. infusions of 250 mL of 40% Ca borogluconate, one immediately after calving and the second 12 to 18 h after first infusion (2SC250; n = 50). Blood samples were collected immediately after parturition and at 1, 2, 4, and 7 d in milk (DIM) for Ca, P, and Mg determination. Milk production, milk composition, and somatic cell count were recorded monthly up to 90 DIM. The evaluation of BCS was performed at calving and at 38 DIM. A subset of 9 cows per treatment group was randomly chosen to measure serum concentration of glucose and BHB at 2, 4, and 7 DIM. Total serum Ca in 1SC250 (8.95 mg/dL), 1SC500 (9.27 mg/dL), and 2SC250 (9.07 mg/dL) was greater during the first week postpartum compared with control (8.45 mg/dL). Serum concentrations of P, Mg, BHB, glucose, and milk yield were not affected by treatments. The dry matter intake during the first 24 h after calving was higher for treatments 1SC250 (13.5 kg), 1SC500 (15.0 kg), and 2SC250 (15.6 kg) relative to control (12.5 kg). Milk somatic cell counts were lower for 1SC500 (90.5 cells/mL) and 2SC250 (82.2 cells/mL) than control (132.8 cells/mL). Risk ratio was >1 for development of metritis, and clinical and subclinical endometritis in control cows relative to 2SC250 cows, which indicates a higher risk of developing disease for control cows (2.03, 1.7, and 1.8 times, respectively). These results suggest that prophylactic s.c. infusions of Ca at calving can improve postpartum Ca status in Holstein cows and intake at 1 DIM.

Ca supplementation on immune status warrants further investigation.","author":[{"family":"Amanlou","given":"H"},{"family":"Akbari","given":"A P"},{"family":"Farsuni","given":"N E"},{"family":"Silva-Del-Río","given":"N"}],"citation-key":"Amanlou2016","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2015-10844","ISSN":"1525-3198","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"1-12","PMID":"27568042","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Effects of subcutaneous calcium administration at calving on mineral status, health, and production of Holstein cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27568042"},
  {"id":"Amanlou2017","abstract":"The objective of this study was to determine the effects of feeding increased dietary crude protein (CP) on productive performance and indicators of protein and energy metabolism during 21 d postpartum. Thirty multiparous Holstein dairy cows were balanced by previous lactation milk yield, body condition score (BCS) at calving, and parity and randomly allocated to 1 of 3 dietary treatments from calving until 21 d postpartum. Dietary treatments were 16.0% CP with 5.0% rumen undegradable protein (RUP) based on dry matter (DM) (16CP), 18.7% CP with 7.0% RUP based on DM (19CP), and 21.4% CP with 9.0% RUP based on DM (21CP). Diets were similar in net energy for lactation (approximately 1.7 Mcal/kg of DM) and CP levels were increased with corn gluten meal and fish meal. Dry matter intake (DMI) was increased by increasing dietary CP levels from 16.0 to 19.0% of DM, but dietary CP beyond 19.0% had no effect on DMI. Milk yields were 4.7 and 6.5 kg/d greater in cows fed the 19CP and 21CP diets versus those fed the 16CP diet, whereas 4% fat-corrected milk was greater for cows fed the 21CP than the 16CP diet (36.0 vs. 31.4 kg/d). Milk protein content and yield, lactose yield, and milk urea nitrogen were elevated by increased dietary CP. Milk lactose content and fat yield were not different among dietary treatments, but milk fat content tended to decline with increasing content of CP in diets. High CP levels increased milk N secretion but decreased milk N efficiency. Apparent digestibility of DM, CP, and neutral detergent fiber was greater on the 19CP and 21CP diets compared with the 16CP diet. Cows fed the 19CP and 21CP diets lost less body condition relative to those fed the 16CP diet over 21 d postpartum. Feeding higher CP levels increased the concentrations of serum albumin, albumin to globulin ratio, and urea nitrogen and decreased aspartate aminotransferase, nonesterified fatty acids, and β-hydroxybutyrate, but had no effect on globulin, glucose, cholesterol, or triacylglycerol.

  {"id":"Amelchanka2010","abstract":"Buckwheat is of high value in crop rotations and overall agricultural ecology because of strong rooting and intensive flowering properties, but it is rarely cultivated and information on its nutritional value to ruminants is scarce. The contents of net energy for lactation (NEL), as estimated with the Hohenheim Gas Test (n = 3), were 4.3, 4.9 and 7.5 MJ NEL/kg dry matter (DM) for fresh and ensiled whole buckwheat plants and buckwheat grain, respectively. In two experiments with the Rumen Simulation Technique (Rusitec), ruminal fermentation characteristics of buckwheat forages and buckwheat grain (n = 4/diet) were evaluated. In the first experiment, 0, 300 or 600 g/kg of a pure hay diet were replaced by either fresh or ensiled buckwheat to create five diets. Neither form of buckwheat forages had effects on in vitro ruminal degradability and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations and composition. The use of fresh buckwheat reduced ruminal ammonia concentrations and enhanced estimated microbial N growth efficiency. These differences did not occur with silage, indicating a change in nutritional value by ensiling. Fresh buckwheat reduced the number of bacteria in the incubated fluid, while ensiled buckwheat reduced that of holotrich protozoa. Methane formation was not influenced by the buckwheat forages. In the second experiment, wheat meal (400 g/kg dietary DM), was replaced stepwise (0.5 and 1.0) by buckwheat grain meal. This did not cause differences in parameters of nutrient degradability, relative N efficiency and total amount and composition of SCFA. Holotrich protozoa counts increased, but total gas formation decreased with increasing dietary level of buckwheat grain. In a final experiment, cows yielding about 40 kg milk/day were fed mixed silage-concentrate diets (n = 4). A control diet contained no buckwheat. In a second diet, maize silage was partly substituted by buckwheat silage (98 g/kg dietary DM). In a third group, part of the energy concentrate was substituted by buckwheat grain meal (94 g/kg). There were no effects on feed intake, milk yield and milk composition. Buckwheat proved to be a plant that offers different feeds of a quality sufficient to be considered suitable in ruminant nutrition. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  {"id":"Ametaj2009","abstract":"The objective of this investigation was to study the effects of feeding backgrounding and finishing diets on selected acute phase proteins in the plasma of feedlot steers. Two groups of 12 steers each, at the backgrounding and finishing stages, were offered either a backgrounding (45% barley grain-based concentrate and 55% barley silage on a DM basis) or a finishing (91% barley grain-based concentrate and 9% barley silage) diet for 12 and 15 wk, respectively. Steers at the backgrounding and finishing stages had initial BW of approximately 250 and 380 kg, respectively, at the beginning of the experiment. Blood samples were obtained from a jugular vein at 3-wk intervals during the experimental period beginning at wk 3 or 0 for the backgrounding and finishing periods, respectively. Plasma samples were analyzed for serum amyloid A (SAA), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), haptoglobin, and alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein. Steers fed the finishing diet showed peak plasma SAA, LBP, and haptoglobin within 3 wk from the initiation of the diet (20, 23, and 1,940 microg/mL for SAA, LBP, and haptoglobin, respectively). Although plasma alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein reached a peak concentration (449 microg/mL) at the beginning of the finishing phase, no diet effect was obtained for this variable. Steers fed the backgrounding diet showed less variation in the concentrations of plasma acute phase proteins measured; plasma haptoglobin reached a peak concentration (1,720 microg/mL) 9 wk after the beginning of this diet. In conclusion, feeding feedlot steers the backgrounding or finishing diet was associated with increased peak concentrations of acute phase proteins in the plasma. More research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms behind the inflammatory responses observed in feedlot steers and their implications for health issues and the production efficiency of feedlot operations.","author":[{"family":"Ametaj","given":"B.

  {"id":"ametaj2025","abstract":"This review highlights a paradigm shift in our understanding of hypocalcemia during milk fever by introducing the concept of the Calci-Inflammatory Network. Traditionally viewed as a pathological deficiency necessitating rapid correction (e.g., through calcium borogluconate infusions or dietary adjustments like dietary cation-anion difference), periparturient hypocalcemia is reinterpreted here as an adaptive, protective response. Within this new framework, reduced circulating calcium levels may help temper systemic inflammation by limiting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) aggregation and curbing excessive macrophage activation. The review discusses how calcium signaling, the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), and immune cell functions adapt under hypocalcemic conditions to modulate inflammatory processes. This integrated perspective not only redefines the role of hypocalcemia but also proposes the Calci-Inflammatory Network as a novel concept through which we can understand how changes in calcium homeostasis mitigate inflammatory cascades—potentially lowering the incidence of periparturient diseases and enhance overall cow health and farm productivity. Future research should investigate the long-term effects of hypocalcemia, the environmental influences on this Calci-Inflammatory Network, and their collective impact on disease susceptibility and inflammation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Ametaj","given":"Burim"}],"citation-key":"ametaj2025","container-title":"Dairy","container-title-short":"Dairy","DOI":"10.3390/dairy6030022","ISSN":"2624-862X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,28]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"22","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Calci-Inflammatory Network: A Paradigm Shift in Understanding Milk Fever","title-short":"The Calci-Inflammatory Network","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2624-862X/6/3/22","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"Amin2021","abstract":"Essential oils (EOs) are generally considered as an alternative to antibiotics because of their antimicrobial properties. Despite their vast variety, their volatile nature poses hindrance on their use in animal feeds, which demands a high degree of stability. This study aimed at testing the susceptibility of three EOs (mixtures of EOs based on cinnamaldehyde, named Olistat-Cyn, Olistat-G, and Olistat-P) in two forms (free: fEOs; and microencapsulated: mEOs) to in vitro ruminal degradation using the Ankom DaisyII technique. The microencapsulation was made using a matrix based on vegetable hydrogenated fatty acids. Compared to the fEOs, which were completely degraded within 48 h of in vitro incubation, the mEOs showed a low ruminal disappearance. In comparison to the fermentation profile at 0 h, Olistat-G significantly decreased the pH and the total protozoa number after 48 h, while the total VFAs increased. However, the other EOs (Olistat-Cyn and Olistat-P) had no effect on the rumen fermentation parameters. In conclusion, the protection of EOs from ruminal degradation by microencapsulation was found to be very effective to ensure rumen by-pass. Among the EOs, Olistat-G was capable of changing rumen fermentation, potentially reducing methane emissions.","author":[{"family":"Amin","given":"Nida"},{"family":"Tagliapietra","given":"Franco"},{"family":"Arango","given":"Sheyla"},{"family":"Guzzo","given":"Nadia"},{"family":"Bailoni","given":"Lucia"}],"citation-key":"Amin2021","container-title":"Animals","DOI":"10.3390/ani11010180","ISSN":"20762615","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"1-12","title":"Free and microencapsulated essential oils incubated in vitro: Ruminal stability and fermentation parameters","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"Amler2006","abstract":"Maize production trials carried out in the middle of eastern Germany from 1999-2005 and were used for statistical analysis of the optimum date for silage maize ripeness. The Silage maize Ripeness Index (SRI, the ratio of dry matter content of maize grains to dry matter content of stover) is more suitable for the determination of harvest date, yield maximum and silage maize quality as the dry matter content of the plant. The analysis is cheaper and less material and time-consuming in comparison to the dry matter content of the silage maize of different hybrid maize populations and environments. Ensilage optimum and yield maximum correspond almost with the physiological ripeness of silage maize and are close to the grain dry matter content of 60-65%, to the dry matter content of stover under 24% and a ripeness index from 2.5 and higher. Recently, the silage maize harvest depends on dry matter content of maize plants (30-35%). This can result in grain ripening rates less than 55% and low starch as well as energy contents. The dry matter content of the silage maize is at a certain ripeness of grain and/or of starch only expression of aging of the stover. When the stover has a stronger influence as the grain on the dry matter content of the whole plant maize, than the crop should be harvested before reaching the optimum of ripeness and yield maximum. Therefore only hybrids with a long harvesting time, high starch storage and displaying a high digestibility of plant cell wall with slow drying of the stover should be grown in the future. The Silage maize Ripeness Index is, for whole plant maize, better than the Whole Plant Maize Ripeness Index (SRZ) for the choice of a hybrid in Germany. The dry matter content of grain in interaction with the dry matter of stover are better than dry matter content of the whole plant maize as ripeness indicator in the production of maize for the harvesting time. SRI is also suitable for use as a standard in scientific trials and for better type-characteristic of varieties. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","author":[{"family":"Amler","given":"Reinhard"}],"citation-key":"Amler2006","container-title":"Gesunde Pflanzen","DOI":"10.1007/s10343-006-0133-z","ISBN":"1034300601","ISSN":"03674223","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"page":"213-224","title":"Die Silomaisernte bei optimaler Silierreife","type":"article-journal","volume":"58"},

  {"id":"Andersen2011","abstract":"An investigation of the shape of the lactation curve and the mastitis incidence was conducted to identify whether management interventions of the lactation curve constitute a potential for reducing incidence of mastitis at herd level. Lactation curves were estimated to describe the variation of daily milk yield during the 305-d lactation period in Norwegian Red cows. Associations between mastitis incidence at herd level and lactation curve characteristics such as production level at onset of lactation, magnitude and time of peak milk yield, and increase and decrease of milk yield rates were studied. Data from 250,303 lactations occurring during 2005 and 2006 from 14,766 herds were obtained from the Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording System. Besides veterinary treatments, the records included information on monthly test-day milk yields. The shapes of the lactation curves at herd level were parameterized using a modified Wilmink model in two separate mixed model analyses. In the first analysis a subset of lactations with no records of veterinary treatments was used. Lactation curves from herds with high (>0·31 cases/305-d lactation) and low (<0·07 cases/305-d lactation) herd mastitis incidence rate were parameterized and compared for three separate strata of parity. The result showed that high herd mastitis incidence rate was associated with a low intercept (P<0·05), a steep slope before peak milk yield (P<0·01) and a rapid decline after peak milk yield (P<0·01). In the second analysis a subset of high-yielding lactations with veterinary treatments of mastitis only and lactations with no records of veterinary treatment were compared. This was done to investigate whether the findings at herd level were also reflected at cow level. These results showed that lactation curves from lactations with mastitis cases were associated with a steep slope before peak milk yield (P<0·05) in second and later parities and a rapid decline after peak milk yield (P<0·01) in all three parity groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Andersen","given":"Fredrik"},{"family":"Østerås","given":"Olav"},{"family":"Reksen","given":"Olav"},{"family":"Gröhn","given":"Yrjo T"}],"citation-key":"Andersen2011","container-title":"The Journal of dairy research","DOI":"10.1017/S0022029910000749","ISSN":"1469-7629","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",2]]},"page":"23-31","PMID":"21118610","title":"Mastitis and the shape of the lactation curve in Norwegian dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21118610","volume":"78"},

  {"id":"Anderson2010","abstract":"The purpose was to determine the association of milk California Mastitis Test (CMT), somatic cell concentration (SCC), and milk differential cell count results on day 3 postcalving with subsequent lactation production and health events. On d 3 postcalving, the CMT was performed and quarter milk samples were collected from 130 dairy cows. Quarter SCC and milk differential cell counts were determined. Microbiology on duplicate quarter milk samples was used to determine the presence of intramammary infection by major or minor pathogens. Production measures obtained using Dairy Herd Improvement Association testing were 150-d standardized and summit milks. Milk culture results on a cow basis included 82 (63.1%) samples with no growth, 31 (23.9%) with major pathogens, and 17 (13.1%) with minor pathogens. Milk culture results comparing cows with no growth to those with any growth (major or minor pathogens) were not associated with statistically significant differences in milk production. Milk culture results comparing cows with major pathogens to those with no growth and minor pathogens combined were associated with statistically significant differences in 150 d milk. Milk production did not differ for cows with CMT results above and below a cut-off of trace, and for SCC results above and below cut-offs of 200,000, 300,000, and 400,000/mL, respectively. Statistically significant differences in milk production were found for cows above and below cut-offs for percentage neutrophils in milk and for absolute neutrophil counts. Associations were found for milk production and number of quarters (0, 1, 2, or 3 and 4 combined) above respective cut-offs for SCC, percentage neutrophils in milk, and absolute numbers of neutrophils in milk, but not for CMT. Milk production differed for cows experiencing any health event versus those with no health event. The most commonly recorded health event was clinical mastitis. Statistically significant associations were detected between health events and milk culture results, SCC, neutrophil percentage, and neutrophil absolute counts. Results of the present investigation indicate that milk monitoring on d 3 of lactation using milk neutrophil percentage or neutrophil absolute counts may be useful as an indication of subsequent milk production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"K L"},{"family":"Correa","given":"M T"},{"family":"Allen","given":"a"},{"family":"Rodriguez","given":"R R"}],"citation-key":"Anderson2010","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2009-2885","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",12]]},"page":"5673-83","PMID":"21094739","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Fresh cow mastitis monitoring on day 3 postpartum and its relationship to subsequent milk production.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21094739","volume":"93"},

The fat supplement was substituted for ground corn and minerals. Two 6-d total collection balance trials were conducted during which cows were in open circuit respiration chambers. Intake of OM was lower for lactating cows fed the fat supplement (18.1 vs. 19.1 kg/d), but energy intake did not differ (93.2 Mcal/d). Total long-chain fatty acid intake was increased from 477 to 820 g/d with fat feeding. Apparent digestibility of long-chain fatty acids was increased 11.1 percentage units with increased dietary CP for lactating cows with no difference in fatty acid digestibility for the dry cows. Milk yield was higher (34.3 vs. 32.0 kg/d) with fat feeding, but milk energy yield did not differ (22.6 Mcal/d). The NEL of the fat supplement was estimated from the incremental differences in energy values within cows, assuming NEL of corn replaced by fat to be 1.96 Mcal/kg DM, and was determined to be 6.52 Mcal/kg DM (SE = 1.74). The efficiency of the use of metabolizable energy for lactation from dietary fat was 77.2%.

  {"id":"Arndt2014","abstract":"The objective of this study was to determine the effect of substituting corn bran (CB) for dried ground corn grain (CG) in the nonforage portion of high-forage (HF) and low-forage (LF) diets. Twelve multiparous and 12 primiparous Holsteins were assigned to 4 diets using six 4× Latin squares with 3-wk periods. Forage was 64 or 38% of the total mixed ration (% of dry matter). On a dry matter basis, the HFCG diet had 20% CG, the LFCG diet had 39% CG, the HFCB diet had 19% CB, and the LFCB diet had 38% CB. Digestible organic matter intake (OMI) and milk energy yield were lower for CB compared with CG within forage level. Digestible OMI was greater (1.9kg/d) for the LFCG compared with the HFCG treatment. When CB replaced forage (LFCB vs. HFCB), digestible OMI was not different but milk energy yield was greater with the LFCB diet. The LFCG diet supported the greatest milk, milk protein, and milk energy yield. Decreased concentration of milk protein and increased concentration of milk urea nitrogen when feeding CB compared with CG suggests that lack of fermentable energy in the CB diets may have limited rumen microbial protein synthesis. Total substitution of CG with CB in the nonforage portion did not support maximum milk production, even when forage was reduced at the same time (HFCG vs. LFCB). Predicted neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility at 1 times maintenance, based on chemical analysis of the individual feeds, was 22 percentage units greater for CB than for the forage mix (68.9 vs. 46.9%). In vitro NDF digestibility (30h) was 19.4 percentage units greater for CB than for the forage mix (68.9 vs. 49.5%). However, in vivo NDF digestibility of the diet when CB replaced forage (HFCB vs. LFCB) was similar (44.1 vs. 44.5%). Similarly, predicted total digestible nutrients at the production level of intake, based on chemical analysis, were greater for the CB treatments and lower for the CG treatments than those observed in vivo.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Arndt","given":"C"},{"family":"Armentano","given":"L E"},{"family":"Hall","given":"M B"}],"citation-key":"Arndt2014","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2013-7815","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",9]]},"page":"5676-87","PMID":"24997669","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Corn bran versus corn grain at 2 levels of forage: Intake, apparent digestibility, and production responses by lactating dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24997669","volume":"97"},

This study aimed to determine the quantitative effects of Ile, Leu, Met, and Thr on the phosphorylation state of signaling proteins that regulate protein synthesis. The experiment used a composite design with a central point, 2 axial points per AA, and a complete 2(4) factorial. All of the other AA were provided at the concentrations in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The experiment was replicated with tissues from 5 lactating cows. Mammary tissue slices (0.12±0.02g) were incubated for 4h. Total and site-specific phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; Ser2448), eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF) 2 (Thr56), ribosomal protein S6 (Ser235/236), and eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (Ser51) were determined by western immunoblotting. Tissue concentrations of the 4 AA studied responded linearly to media supply. Addition of Ile, Leu, Met, or Thr had no effect on eukaryotic initiation factor 2α phosphorylation. Isoleucine and Thr positively affected mTOR phosphorylation. However, the 2 AA had an antagonistic relationship. Similarly, Ile linearly increased ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation, and Thr inhibited the Ile effect. In addition, eEF2 phosphorylation was linearly decreased by Ile and Leu. Threonine curvilinearly decreased eEF2 phosphorylation, Ile and Leu negatively interacted on eEF2, and Thr tended to inhibit Leu effects on eEF2. This work demonstrated saturable responses and interactions between AA on activation of the mTOR pathway. Incorporation of these concepts into milk protein response models will help to improve milk and milk protein yield predictions and increase postabsorptive N efficiency and reduce N excretion by dairy cows.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Arriola Apelo","given":"S I"},{"family":"Singer","given":"L M"},{"family":"Lin","given":"X Y"},{"family":"McGilliard","given":"M L"},{"family":"St-Pierre","given":"N R"},{"family":"Hanigan","given":"M D"}],"citation-key":"ArriolaApelo2014","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2013-7348","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3]]},"page":"1047-56","PMID":"24359813","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Isoleucine, leucine, methionine, and threonine effects on mammalian target of rapamycin signaling in mammary tissue.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24359813","volume":"97"},
  {"id":"Arshad2019","abstract":"The objectives were to use meta-analytic methods to determine the effects of amount of supplemental choline ion as rumen-protected choline (RPC) starting prepartum on production and health of dairy cows. The literature was systematically reviewed and 21 experiments, with up to 66 treatment means and 1,313 prepartum parous cows, were included. All experiments had a treatment with no supplemental choline (0 g/d; n = 30 treatment means), and the amount of choline ion supplemented to treated cows ranged from 5.6 to 25.2 g/d (n = 36 treatment means). Duration of pre- and postpartum feeding of RPC averaged (±standard deviation) 22.0 ± 6.0 and 57.5 ± 42.2 d, respectively. Data collected included the ingredient composition and chemical analyses of pre- and postpartum diets, amount of choline ion supplemented, number of cows per treatment, frequency of health events, and the least squares means and respective standard error of the means for production responses, liver composition, and blood parameters. The concentrations of net energy for lactation and metabolizable amino acids and protein (MP) in pre- and postpartum diets were predicted for each treatment mean using National Research Council (2001). Mixed model meta-analysis was conducted including the random effect of experiment and weighting by the inverse of the standard error of the means squared. Increasing supplementation of choline ion during transition linearly increased pre- (β = 0.0184 ± 0.00425) and postpartum dry matter intake (β = 0.0378 ± 0.00974), and yields of milk (β = 0.436 ± 0.112), energy-corrected milk (ECM; β = 0.422 ± 0.0992), fat (β = 0.00555 ± 0.000793), and protein (β = 0.0138 ± 0.00378). Nevertheless, an interaction between choline and postpartum metabolizable methionine as a percent of MP (METMPPo) was observed for yields of milk, ECM, and protein because as METMPPo increased, the positive response to choline on yields of milk, ECM, and protein decreased. Supplementing choline during transition tended to reduce the risks of retained placenta and mastitis, but it had no effect on metritis, milk fever, displaced abomasum and ketosis, or the concentration of triacylglycerol in the hepatic tissue postpartum. The median amount of choline ion supplemented was 12.9 g/d and responses in postpartum dry matter intake and yields of milk, ECM, fat, and protein to that amount of supplementation were 0.5, 1.6, 1.7, 0.07, and 0.05 kg/d, respectively. No interactions were observed between supplemental choline and prepartum dietary net energy for lactation or metabolizable methionine as a percent of MP. Collectively, feeding RPC during the transition period improves performance in parous cows. Increases in yields of milk and milk components were observed in spite of pre- and postpartum diets, although the increments in milk, ECM, and protein yields with supplementing choline decreased as the concentration of methionine in postpartum diets increased. The optimum dose of choline ion was not detected, but likely it is more than the 12.9 g/d fed in most experiments evaluated in the current meta-analysis. Finally, the meta-analysis identified lack of sufficient data to understand the role of supplemental choline in nulliparous cows.","author":[{"family":"Arshad","given":"U."},{"family":"Zenobi","given":"M.

Some data collection techniques in PLF such as RFID are accurate but not affordable for small- and medium-sized farms. On the other hand, camera sensors are cheap, commonly available, and easily used to collect information compared to other sensor systems in precision pig farming. Cameras have ample chance to monitor pigs with high precision at an affordable cost. However, the lack of targeted information about the application of cameras in the pig industry is a shortcoming for swine farmers and researchers. This review describes the state of the art in 3D imaging systems (i.e., depth sensors and time-of-flight cameras), along with 2D cameras, for effectively identifying pig behaviors, and presents automated approaches for monitoring and investigating pigs’ feeding, drinking, lying, locomotion, aggressive, and reproductive behaviors. In addition, the review summarizes the related literature and points out limitations to open up new dimensions for future researchers to explore.\n\nAbstract\nPork is the meat with the second-largest overall consumption, and chicken, pork, and beef together account for 92% of global meat production.

  {"id":"aschenbach2019","abstract":"ABSTRACT The stratified squamous ruminal epithelium is the main site for absorption of key nutrients (e.g., short-chain fatty acids; SCFA) and electrolytes (e.g., sodium and magnesium). The absorptive function has to be highly selective to prevent simultaneous entry of microbes and toxins from the rumen into the blood. As such, epithelial absorption is primarily transcellular, whereas the paracellular pathway appears rather tightly sealed. A network of tight junction (claudin-1, claudin-4, and occludin) and tight junction-associated proteins (e.g., zonula occludens) accomplishes the latter. When microbial fermentation activity is high such as with highly fermentable diets, rumen epithelial functions are often challenged by acidity, high osmolarity, toxins (e.g., endotoxin and histamine), and immune mediators (inflammatory mediators and cytokines) released during local and systemic inflammation. Epithelial damage by low pH in combination with high luminal SCFA concentrations is not immediately reversible and may initially aggravate upon return to physiological pH. In contrast, barrier opening upon hyperosmolarity is acutely transient. The initial insults set by luminal acidity and SCFA and the increasing concentrations of microbial-associated molecular patterns such as lipopolysaccharides are key factors that trigger inflammation not only in the rumen but also in the hindgut (cecum and colon), which reach out to the liver and other organs, causing systemic inflammation. Low feed intake during parturition, transportation, heat stress, or disease is the second most relevant challenge for the ruminal epithelial barrier. The barrier opening is usually only transient and quickly restored upon refeeding. Due to a rapid, dose-dependent, and prolonged decrease in absorption capacity for SCFA, however, any feed restriction increases the odds for postrestriction subacute ruminal acidosis. Inflammation due to acidosis can be alleviated by supplemental thiamine, yeasts, and plant bioactive (phytogenic) compounds. Butyrate is used in weaning calves to support ruminal barrier development; however, excess butyrate may promote hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, and epithelial injury in the fully developed rumen of adult cows. Further research is needed to enhance the understanding of the various factors that counteract barrier impairment and help barrier restoration during acidogenic feeding, especially when concurring with unavoidable periods of feed restriction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Aschenbach","given":"Jörg R."},{"family":"Zebeli","given":"Qendrim"},{"family":"Patra","given":"Amlan K."},{"family":"Greco","given":"Gabriele"},{"family":"Amasheh","given":"Salah"},{"family":"Penner","given":"Gregory B."}],"citation-key":"aschenbach2019","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/JDS.2018-15243","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,1]]},"page":"1866-1882","PMID":"30580938","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Symposium review: The importance of the ruminal epithelial barrier for a healthy and productive cow*","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030218310993/fulltext","volume":"102"},

  {"id":"Atzori2013","abstract":"The economic efficiency of dairy farms is the main goal of farmers. The objective of this work was to use routinely available information at the dairy farm level to develop an index of profitability to rank dairy farms and to assist the decision-making process of farmers to increase the economic efficiency of the entire system. A stochastic modeling approach was used to study the relationships between inputs and profitability (i.e., income over feed cost; IOFC) of dairy cattle farms. The IOFC was calculated as: milk revenue + value of male calves + culling revenue - herd feed costs. Two databases were created. The first one was a development database, which was created from technical and economic variables collected in 135 dairy farms. The second one was a synthetic database (sDB) created from 5,000 synthetic dairy farms using the Monte Carlo technique and based on the characteristics of the development database data. The sDB was used to develop a ranking index as follows: (1) principal component analysis (PCA), excluding IOFC, was used to identify principal components (sPC); and (2) coefficient estimates of a multiple regression of the IOFC on the sPC were obtained. Then, the eigenvectors of the sPC were used to compute the principal component values for the original 135 dairy farms that were used with the multiple regression coefficient estimates to predict IOFC (dRI; ranking index from development database). The dRI was used to rank the original 135 dairy farms. The PCA explained 77.6% of the sDB variability and 4 sPC were selected. The sPC were associated with herd profile, milk quality and payment, poor management, and reproduction based on the significant variables of the sPC. The mean IOFC in the sDB was 0.1377 ± 0.0162 euros per liter of milk (€/L). The dRI explained 81% of the variability of the IOFC calculated for the 135 original farms. When the number of farms below and above 1 standard deviation (SD) of the dRI were calculated, we found that 21 farms had dRI < -1 SD, 32 farms were between -1 SD and 0, 67 farms were between 0 and +1 SD, and 15 farms had dRI > +1 SD. The top 10% of the farms had a dRI greater than 0.170 €/L, whereas the bottom 10% farms had a dRI lower than 0.116 €/L. This stochastic approach allowed us to understand the relationships among the inputs of the studied dairy farms and to develop a ranking index for comparison purposes. The developed methodology may be improved by using more inputs at the dairy farm level and considering the actual cost to measure profitability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Atzori","given":"a S"},{"family":"Tedeschi","given":"L O"},{"family":"Cannas","given":"a"}],"citation-key":"Atzori2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-6256","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",2,28]]},"page":"3378-3387","PMID":"23453520","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"A multivariate and stochastic approach to identify key variables to rank dairy farms on profitability.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23453520","volume":"96"},

  {"id":"Bach2007a","abstract":"A longitudinal study involving 73 primiparous (PP) and 47 multiparous (MP) Holstein cows was conducted over an 8-month period to assess the associations between locomotion score (LCS) and milk production, dry matter intake (DMI), feeding behaviour, and number of visits to an automatic milking system (AMS). Twice weekly, all cows were locomotion scored (scale 1-5) by the same observer. Individual eating behaviour and individual feed consumption at each cow visit to the feed troughs, individual milk production, the time of milking, and the number of milkings for each cow were recorded for the day of locomotion scoring and the day before and after. Dependent variables, such as milk yield, DMI, etc. were modelled using a mixed-effects model with parity, LCS, days in milk (DIM), the exponential of -0.05 DIM, and the interaction between parity and LCS, as fixed effects and random intercepts and random slopes for the linear and the exponential of -0.05DIM effects within cow. LCS did not affect time of attendance at feed troughs, but affected the location that cows occupied in the feed troughs. The time devoted to eating and DMI decreased with increasing LCS. Milk production decreased with LCS>3. The number of daily visits to the AMS also decreased with increasing LCS. The cows with high LCS were fetched more often than the cows with low LCS. Overall, PP cows were more sensitive to the effects of increasing LCS than were MP cows. The decrease in milk production observed with increasing LCS seemed to be affected similarly by the decrease in DMI and by the decrease in number of daily visits to the AMS. A further economic loss generated by lame cows with AMS will be associated with the additional labour needed to fetch them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Bach","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Dinarés","given":"Martí"},{"family":"Devant","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Carré","given":"Xavier"}],"citation-key":"Bach2007a","container-title":"The Journal of dairy research","DOI":"10.1017/S0022029906002184","ISBN":"0022029906002","ISSN":"0022-0299","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",2]]},"page":"40-6","PMID":"16978436","title":"Associations between lameness and production, feeding and milking attendance of Holstein cows milked with an automatic milking system.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16978436","volume":"74"},

One hundred fifteen lactating cows were used in a cross-over design with 2 periods of 90 d each and 2 treatments: low concentrate (LC; up to 3 kg/d of concentrate at the AMS) or high concentrate (HC; up to 8 kg/d of concentrate at the AMS). Cows were evenly distributed in 2 symmetrical pens, each containing 1 AMS and about 50 cows at any given time. All cows received the same total ration (28% corn silage, 1.67 Mcal of net energy for lactation/kg, 16.5% crude protein, DM basis), but a different amount of concentrate from this ration was offered at the AMS depending on treatment. The concentrate at the AMS had the same composition in both treatments. Cows were fetched when time elapsed, because last milking was greater than 12 h. The amount of concentrate offered at the AMS was proportional to the time elapsed since last visit (125 and 333 g/h for LC and HC, respectively). Milk production, total number of daily milkings, number of cows fetched, or number of voluntary milkings were not affected by treatments. The consumption of basal ration was greater in LC than in HC, but this difference was compensated by a greater consumption of concentrate at the AMS in HC than LC cows. Total dry matter intake tended to be lower, therefore, in HC than in LC cows. Eating rate of the basal ration was greater in LC than in HC, but the total amount of time that cows devoted to eat was similar between treatments. Offering high amounts of concentrate to the AMS feeding a basal ration rich in corn silage did not diminish the need for fetching cows and did not increase the number of daily milkings nor milk production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Bach","given":"a"},{"family":"Iglesias","given":"C"},{"family":"Calsamiglia","given":"S"},{"family":"Devant","given":"M"}],"citation-key":"Bach2007b","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2007-0347","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",11]]},"page":"5049-55","PMID":"17954744","title":"Effect of amount of concentrate offered in automatic milking systems on milking frequency, feeding behavior, and milk production of dairy cattle consuming high amounts of corn silage.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17954744","volume":"90"},
  {"id":"Bach2008","abstract":"Forty-seven dairy herds (approximately 3,129 lactating cows) from northeast of Spain that were offering exactly the same lactating ration were surveyed to determine the effect of nondietary factors on herd performance. The survey collected information on the profile of the owners (their future intentions, the number of workers, and time devoted to the enterprise), information regarding the animals (reproductive performance, incidence of pathology, culling rate, etc.), information on the facilities (number of feeders, waters, stalls, cleanliness, etc.) and information on management practices (numbers of daily milkings, feed deliveries, feed push-ups, cleaning frequency, etc.). In addition, the chemical quality of drinking water from each dairy enterprise was determined. Also, amount of feed delivered to each herd, daily total milk production, and milk quality were obtained for each herd for a period of 8 mo before the fulfillment of the survey. Mortality rate of calves tended to be lesser in herds that weaned progressively than in those that weaned abruptly. Age at first calving was negatively correlated with level of milk production (mainly due to the type of heifer rearing system used). Culling rate tended to be lower in herds that used a close-up ration than in those that did not. Using gloves and paper towels (instead of cloth towels) tended to reduce the somatic cell count in milk. Concentration of calcium in the drinking water tended to be negatively correlated with the number of days open and with the proportion of cows culled due to infertility problems. Despite that the 47 herds fed the same ration and shared a similar genetic base, average milk production per cow ranged from 20.6 to 33.8 kg/d. A positive relationship (r = 0.57) between the number of stalls per cow and milk production was found. The most important nondietary factors that affected milk production in these dairy herds were age at first calving, presence or absence of feed refusals, number of free stalls per lactating cow, and whether feed was pushed up in the feed bunk. These factors accounted for more than 50% of the observed variation, not attributable to the diet, in milk yield.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Bach","given":"A"},{"family":"Valls","given":"N"},{"family":"Solans","given":"a"},{"family":"Torrent","given":"T"}],"citation-key":"Bach2008","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2008-1030","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",8]]},"page":"3259-67","PMID":"18650303","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Associations between nondietary factors and dairy herd performance.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18650303","volume":"91"},

  {"id":"bach2011a","abstract":"A data set from 7,768 Holstein heifers born between 2004 and 2006, including growth rates from birth until first calving; age and body weight at insemination; and incidence of diarrhea, navel infections, and bovine respiratory disease (BRD) was used to evaluate potential associations between these factors and the odds of completing the first lactation. All heifers were raised in a contract heifer operation (Rancho Las Nieves, Mallen, Spain) and returned to their herds of origin (133 herds in total) before calving. Dates of death were provided by the Subdirección General de Explotaciones y Sistemas de Trazabilidad de los Recursos Agrícolas y Ganaderos from the Ministry of Environment, and Rural and Marine Areas of the Spanish government. At the time of analysis, 2,571 (33.1%) animals out of the 7,768 considered had died. In total, 655 (8.4%) heifers did not finish first lactation, and 31.5% of these left the herd within the first 50 DIM. Also, 4.8% of heifers aborted and were rebred. Data were analyzed using a mixed-effects logistic regression and survival analysis for dichotomous variables and a mixed-effects model for continuous ones. Incidence of diarrhea or navel infection was not associated with the chances of finishing the first lactation. Heifers that completed first lactation had a lesser average age at first calving (724±2 d) than those that did not (737±3 d). Heifers that reached second lactation grew (0.8±0.04 kg/d) more between 12 and 65 d of age than those that did not (0.7±0.04kg/d). As conception rate decreased, chances of leaving the herd before completing the first lactation increased. The number of AI services needed per conception as a nulliparous heifer was negatively associated with survivorship to second lactation. Heifers that experienced an abortion were 2.73±0.52 times more likely to leave the herd before completing the first lactation (but also calved with a much older age at first calving). Heifers that experienced 4 or more BRD cases before first calving had 1.87±0.14 greater odds of not completing the first lactation than those that never experienced BRD. These results show potential to forecast future heifer success in finishing the first lactation based on average daily gain early in life, incidence of BRD, reproductive performance (conception and abortion rates), and age at first calving.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Bach","given":"A."}],"citation-key":"bach2011a","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2010-3633","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",2,1]]},"page":"1052-1057","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Associations between several aspects of heifer development and dairy cow survivability to second lactation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030211000531","volume":"94"},
  {"id":"Bach2018","abstract":"With the objective of evaluating the potential effects of sodium bicarbonate or a magnesium-based product on rumen pH and milk performance of dairy cattle exposed to a dietary challenge, 30 lactating Holstein cows (648 ± 67 kg of body weight; 44.4 ± 9.9 kg/d of milk yield; 155 ± 75 d in milk) were blocked by parity (9 primiparous and 21 multiparous) and randomly distributed to 3 treatment groups. One group received a total mixed ration (TMR) that acted as a control (CTR), a second group (SB) received the same TMR but with an additional supplementation of 0.8% of sodium bicarbonate, and a third group (MG) received the same TMR as CTR but an additional supplementation of 0.4% of a magnesium-based product (pHix-Up, Timab, Dinard, France). After 1 wk of exposure to this TMR, all 3 rations were supplemented with 1 kg/d of barley, which was then increased 1 kg/wk until reaching 3 kg/d of barley during wk 4 of the study. Every kilogram of barley replaced 1 kg of forage in the diet. Individual feed intake and behavior were monitored using electronic feed bins. Seven cows per treatment were equipped with an intraruminal bolus that recorded pH every 15 min. As the severity of the barley challenge increased, dry matter intake decreased, but this decrease was more pronounced in SB cows than in MG cows, with an intermediate response for CTR cows. The MG cows produced more milk when challenged with 2 or 3 kg/d of additional barley than when challenged with 1 kg/d, whereas CTR cows produced less milk with the 3 kg/d challenge compared with 1 or 2 kg/d, and the SB cows maintained milk production. Milk fat content decreased with barley challenges, with CTR cows experiencing a more severe decrease than SB cows, which maintained stable butterfat values throughout the study, and MG cows showed a decline in milk fat content only with the 3 kg/d of additional barley. Meal size was also reduced as the severity of barley challenge increased, and this reduction was more modest in MG cows than in SB cows. The number of daily meals consumed by SB and MG cows was more constant than that recorded in CTR cows. Cows on the CTR and SB treatments showed a marked decrease in rumen pH with the 3 kg/d of additional barley, whereas MG cows maintained stable rumen pH during the barley challenges and had greater average rumen pH (5.93 ± 0.04) than CTR cows (5.83 ± 0.04) with the 3 kg/d of additional barley; SB cows showed intermediate values (5.85 ± 0.04). Last, MG cows spent less time (32.3 ± 6.1%) with rumen pH ≤5.8 when exposed to the 3 kg/d of barley challenge than CTR and SB cows (50.7 ± 5.02%). In conclusion, supplementation with MG prevents the decline in dry matter intake and milk production induced by a rumen challenge, whereas supplementation with SB prevents the decay in milk production but does not prevent the decrease in feed intake. These changes were probably due to the ability of the MG treatment to prevent a reduction in rumen pH when challenging cows with 3 kg/d of additional barley in the ration.","author":[{"family":"Bach","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Guasch","given":"Isabel"},{"family":"Elcoso","given":"Guillermo"},{"family":"Duclos","given":"Julie"},{"family":"Khelil-Arfa","given":"Hajer"}],"citation-key":"Bach2018","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2017-14353","ISSN":"15253198","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"9777-9788","PMID":"30172393","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Modulation of rumen pH by sodium bicarbonate and a blend of different sources of magnesium oxide in lactating dairy cows submitted to a concentrate challenge","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-14353","volume":"101"},

  {"id":"Bahrami-Yekdangi2014","abstract":"This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of decreasing dietary protein and rumen-undegradable protein (RUP) on production performance, nitrogen retention, and nutrient digestibility in high-producing Holstein cows in early lactation. Twelve multiparous Holstein lactating cows (2 lactations; 50 ± 7 d in milk; 47 kg/d of milk production) were used in a Latin square design with 4 treatments and 3 replicates (cows). Treatments 1 to 4 consisted of diets containing 18, 17.2, 16.4, and 15.6% crude protein (CP), respectively, with the 18% CP diet considered the control group. Rumen-degradable protein levels were constant across the treatments (approximately 10.9% on a dry matter basis), whereas RUP was gradually decreased. All diets were calculated to supply a postruminal Lys:Met ratio of about 3:1. Dietary CP had no significant effects on milk production or milk composition. In fact, 16.4% dietary CP compared with 18% dietary CP led to higher milk production; however, this effect was not significant. Feed intake was higher for 16.4% CP than for 18% CP (25.7 vs. 24.3 kg/d). Control cows had greater CP and RUP intakes, which resulted in higher concentrations of plasma urea nitrogen and milk urea nitrogen; cows receiving 16.4 and 15.6% CP, respectively, exhibited lower concentrations of milk urea nitrogen (15.2 and 15.1 vs. 17.3 mg/dL). The control diet had a significant effect on predicted urinary N. Higher CP digestibility was recorded for 18% CP compared with the other diets. Decreasing CP and RUP to 15.6 and 4.6% of dietary dry matter, respectively, had no negative effects on milk production or composition when the amounts of Lys and Met and the Lys:Met ratio were balanced. Furthermore, decreasing CP and RUP to 16.4 and 5.4%, respectively, increased dry matter intake.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Bahrami-Yekdangi","given":"H"},{"family":"Khorvash","given":"M"},{"family":"Ghorbani","given":"G R"},{"family":"Alikhani","given":"M"},{"family":"Jahanian","given":"R"},{"family":"Kamalian","given":"E"}],"citation-key":"Bahrami-Yekdangi2014","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2013-6725","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,26]]},"page":"3707-3714","PMID":"24679928","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effects of decreasing metabolizable protein and rumen-undegradable protein on milk production and composition and blood metabolites of Holstein dairy cows in early lactation.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24679928","volume":"97"},
  {"id":"Baines2011","abstract":"Background: Escherichia coli O157:H7 is the most common serovar of enterohemorrhagic E. coli associated with serious human disease outbreaks. Cattle are the main reservoir with E. coli O157:H7 inducing hemorrhagic enteritis in persistent shedding beef cattle, however little is known about how this pathogen affects cattle health. Jejunal Hemorrhage Syndrome (JHS) has unclear etiology but the pathology is similar to that described for E. coli O157:H7 challenged beef cattle suggestive that E. coli O157:H7 could be involved. There are no effective treatments for JHS however new approaches to managing pathogen issues in livestock using prebiotics and probiotics are gaining support. The first objective of the current study was to characterize pathogen colonization in hemorrhaged jejunum of dairy cattle during natural JHS outbreaks. The second objective was to confirm the association of mycotoxigenic fungi in feeds with the development of JHS and also to identify the presence of potential mycotoxins. The third objective was to determine the impact of a prebiotic, Celmanax™, or probiotic, Dairyman's Choice™ paste, on the cytotoxicity associated with feed extracts in vitro. The fourth objective was to determine the impact of a prebiotic or a probiotic on E. coli O157:H7 colonization of mucosal explants and a bovine colonic cell line in vitro. The final objective was to determine if prebiotic and probiotic feed additives could modify the symptoms that preceded JHS losses and the development of new JHS cases. Findings: Dairy cattle developed JHS after consuming feed containing several types of mycotoxigenic fungi including Fusarium culmorum, F. poae, F. verticillioides, F. sporotrichioides, Aspergillusflavus, Penicillium roqueforti, P. crustosum, P. paneum and P. citrinum. Mixtures of Shiga toxin -producing Escherichia coli (STEC) colonized the mucosa in the hemorrhaged tissues of the cattle and no other pathogen was identified. The STECs expressed Stx1 and Stx2, but more significantly, Stxs were also present in the blood clot blocking the jejunum. Mycotoxin analysis of the corn crop confirmed the presence of fumonisin, NIV, ZEAR, DON, 15-ADON, 3-ADON, NEO, DAS, HT-2 and T-2. Feed extracts were toxic to enterocytes and 0.1% Celmanax™ removed the cytotoxicity in vitro. There was no effect of Dairyman's Choice™ paste on feed-extract activity in vitro. Fumonisin, T-2, ZEAR and DON were toxic to bovine cells and 0.1% Celmanax™ removed the cytotoxicity in vitro. Celmanax™ also directly decreased E. coli O157:H7 colonization of mucosal explants and a colonic cell line in a dose-dependent manner.

STEC are considered commensal bacteria in mature cattle suggesting that mycotoxins provide a mechanism that converts this bacterium to an opportunistic pathogen. In this study, we assessed the mycotoxin content of hemorrhaged mucosa in dairy calves during natural disease outbreaks, compared the virulence genes of the STECs, evaluated the effect of the mucosal mycotoxins on STEC toxin expression and evaluated a Celmanax®/Dairyman’s Choice™ application to alleviate disease. As for human infections, the OI-122 encoded nleB gene was common to STEC genotypes eliciting serious disease. Low levels of aflatoxin (1–3 ppb) and fumonisin (50–350 ppb) were detected in the hemorrhaged mucosa. Growth of the STECs with the mycotoxins altered the secreted protein concentration with a corresponding increase in cytotoxicity. Changes in intracellular calcium indicated that the mycotoxins increased enterotoxin and pore-forming toxin activity. A prebiotic/probiotic application eliminated the morbidity and mortality losses associated with the STEC infections. Our study demonstrates: the same STEC disease complex exists for immature and mature cattle; the significance of the OI-122 pathogenicity island to virulence; the significance of mycotoxins to STEC toxin activity; and, finally, provides further evidence that prebiotic/probiotic applications alleviate STEC shedding and mycotoxin/STEC interactions that lead to disease.","author":[{"family":"Baines","given":"Danica"},{"family":"Sumarah","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Kuldau","given":"Gretchen"},{"family":"Juba","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Mazza","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Masson","given":"Luke"}],"citation-key":"Baines2013","container-title":"Toxins","DOI":"10.3390/toxins5101872","ISSN":"20726651","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"1872-1895","PMID":"24152990","title":"Aflatoxin, fumonisin and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infections in calves and the effectiveness of celmanax®/dairyman's choice™ applications to eliminate morbidity and mortality losses","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6651/5/10/1872/htm","volume":"5"},

The objective was to evaluate the effect of HMTBa supplementation on milk fat synthesis in cows with different levels of milk production and fed diets with increasing risk of biohydrogenation-induced MFD. Sixteen high-producing cows (44.1 ± 4.5 kg of milk/d; mean ± SD) and 14 low-producing (31.4 ± 4.3 kg of milk/d) were used in a randomized block design. Treatments were unsupplemented control and HMTBa fed at 0.1% of diet dry matter (25 g/d at 25 kg of dry matter intake). The experiment was 70 d and included a 14-d covariate period followed by 3 phases whereby diets were fed with increasing risk of MFD to determine the interaction of treatment and diet-induced MFD. During the low-risk phase, the base diet was balanced to 33.5% neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and had no exogenous oil (28 d); during the moderate-risk phase, the diet was balanced to 31% NDF and contained 0.75% soybean oil (14 d); and, during the high-risk phase, the diet was balanced to 28.5% NDF and contained 1.5% soybean oil (14 d). An interaction of treatment, production-level, and dietary phase was observed. Low producing cows neither experienced substantial biohydrogenation-induced MFD nor a response in milk fat to HMTBa supplementation. In high-producing cows, HMTBa maintained higher milk fat concentration during the moderate- (2.94 vs. 3.49%) and high-risk (2.38 vs. 3.11%) phases. High-producing cows receiving HMTBa also had greater milk fat yield (0.94 vs. 1.16 kg/d) and lower trans-10 C18:1 (6.11 vs. 1.50) during the high-risk phase.

  {"id":"baldinEffect2hydroxy4Methylthio2022","abstract":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2><p>Biohydrogenation-induced milk fat depression (MFD) is a reduction in milk fat synthesis caused by bioactive fatty acids (FA) produced during altered ruminal microbial metabolism of unsaturated FA. The methionine analog 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)butanoate (HMTBa) has been shown to reduce the shift to the alternate biohydrogenation pathway and maintain higher milk fat yield in high-producing cows fed diets lower in fiber and higher in unsaturated FA. The objective of this experiment was to verify the effect of HMTBa on biohydrogenation-induced MFD and investigate associated changes in rumen environment and fermentation. Twenty-two rumen cannulated high-producing Holstein cows [168 ± 66 d in milk; 42 ± 7 kg of milk/d (mean ± standard deviation)] were used in a randomized design performed in 2 blocks (1 = 14 cows, 2=8 cows). Treatments were control (corn carrier) and HMTBa (0.1% of diet dry matter). The experiment included a 7-d covariate period followed by 3 phases that fed diets with increasing risk of MFD. The diet during the covariate and low-risk phase (7 d) was 32% neutral detergent fiber with no additional oil. The diet during the moderate-risk phase (17 d) was 29% neutral detergent fiber with 0.75% soybean oil. Soybean oil was increased to 1.5% for the last 4 d. The statistical model included the random effect of block and time course data were analyzed with repeated measures including the random effect of cow and tested the interaction of treatment and time. There was no effect of block or interaction of block and treatment or time. There was no overall effect of treatment or treatment by time interaction for dry matter intake, milk yield, and milk protein concentration and yield. Overall, HMTBa increased milk fat percent (3.2 vs. 3.6%) and yield (1,342 vs. 1,543 g/d) and there was no interaction of treatment and dietary phase. Additionally, HMTBa decreased the concentration of <i>trans</i>-10 18:1 in milk fat and rumen digesta. Average total ruminal concentration of volatile FA across the day and total-tract dry matter and fiber digestibility were not affected by HMTBa, but HMTBa increased average rumen butyrate and decreased propionate concentration and increased total protozoa abundance. Additionally, HMTBa increased the fractional rate of α-linoleic acid clearance from the rumen following a bolus predominantly driven by a difference in the first 30 min. Plasma insulin was decreased by HMTBa. In conclusion, HMTBa prevented the increase in <i>trans</i> FA in milk fat associated with MFD through a mechanism that is independent of total volatile FA concentration, but involves modification of rumen biohydrogenation. Decreased propionate and increased butyrate and ruminal protozoa may also have functional roles in the mechanism.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Baldin","given":"M."},{"family":"Garcia","given":"D."},{"family":"Zanton","given":"G.I."},{"family":"Hao","given":"F."},{"family":"Patterson","given":"A.D."},{"family":"Harvatine","given":"K.J."}],"citation-key":"baldinEffect2hydroxy4Methylthio2022","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/JDS.2022-21910","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,1]]},"page":"7446-7461","PMID":"35931483","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)butanoate (HMTBa) on milk fat, rumen environment and biohydrogenation, and rumen protozoa in lactating cows fed diets with increased risk for milk fat depression","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030222004374/fulltext","volume":"105"},

  {"id":"bastiaansenLongtermResponseGenomic2012","abstract":"Genomic selection has become an important tool in the genetic improvement of animals and plants. The objective of this study was to investigate the impacts of breeding value estimation method, reference population structure, and trait genetic architecture, on long-term response to genomic selection without updating marker effects. Three methods were used to estimate genomic breeding values: a BLUP method with relationships estimated from genome-wide markers (GBLUP), a Bayesian method, and a partial least squares regression method (PLSR). A shallow (individuals from one generation) or deep reference population (individuals from five generations) was used with each method. The effects of the different selection approaches were compared under four different genetic architectures for the trait under selection. Selection was based on one of the three genomic breeding values, on pedigree BLUP breeding values, or performed at random. Selection continued for ten generations. Differences in long-term selection response were small. For a genetic architecture with a very small number of three to four quantitative trait loci (QTL), the Bayesian method achieved a response that was 0.05 to 0.1 genetic standard deviation higher than other methods in generation 10. For genetic architectures with approximately 30 to 300 QTL, PLSR (shallow reference) or GBLUP (deep reference) had an average advantage of 0.2 genetic standard deviation over the Bayesian method in generation 10. GBLUP resulted in 0.6% and 0.9% less inbreeding than PLSR and BM and on average a one third smaller reduction of genetic variance. Responses in early generations were greater with the shallow reference population while long-term response was not affected by reference population structure. The ranking of estimation methods was different with than without selection. Under selection, applying GBLUP led to lower inbreeding and a smaller reduction of genetic variance while a similar response to selection was achieved. The reference population structure had a limited effect on long-term accuracy and response. Use of a shallow reference population, most closely related to the selection candidates, gave early benefits while in later generations, when marker effects were not updated, the estimation of marker effects based on a deeper reference population did not pay off.","author":[{"family":"Bastiaansen","given":"J.W."},{"family":"Coster","given":"A."},{"family":"Calus","given":"M.P."},{"family":"Arendonk","given":"J.A.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Bovenhuis","given":"H."}],"citation-key":"bastiaansenLongtermResponseGenomic2012","container-title":"Genetics, selection, evolution : GSE","DOI":"10.1186/1297-9686-44-3","ISSN":"12979686","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"title":"Long-term response to genomic selection: effects of estimation method and reference population structure for different genetic architectures.","type":"article-journal","volume":"44"},

First, advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of milk secretion has led to a substantial increase in our knowledge of the intracellular origin of lipid droplets and the identity and potential function of milk fat globule membrane proteins in milk-lipid secretion. Second, recent breakthroughs have advanced our understanding of the nutritional regulation of milk fat and highlighted the interrelations between dietary components, digestive processes in the rumen, and the regulation of mammary synthesis of milk fat. Third, nutritional quality is becoming increasingly important in food choices because of consumer awareness of the links between diet and health. The traditional nutritional value of milk and dairy products is well established, but recent discoveries have identified a number of \"bioactive\" components in milk with potential to improve human health. Finally, the concept of genetic engineering and the use of animals as \"bioreactors\" and the \"pharming\" of proteins not normally found in milk have gained recognition, with the dairy industry ideally suited to take advantage of advances in these areas. © American Dairy Science Association, 2006.","author":[{"family":"Bauman","given":"D.E."},{"family":"Mather","given":"I.H."},{"family":"Wall","given":"R.J."},{"family":"Lock","given":"A.L."}],"citation-key":"Bauman2006","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.s0022-0302(06)72192-0","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"page":"1235-1243","title":"Major Advances Associated with the Biosynthesis of Milk","type":"article-journal","volume":"89"},

The objective of this study was to compare reduction in bacterial populations of teat skin after premilking preparation using either predipping with 0.5% iodine followed by drying (conventional; CONV) or using a semiautomated teat scrubber that uses chlorine dioxide (TS; FutureCow, Longwood, FL). Ten farms currently using a commercial teat scrubber system were enrolled. Cows (n=40 per farm) were assigned to CONV (n=198) or TS (n=196) premilking udder preparation. Teat skin swabs were collected before and after udder preparation and analyzed for total bacterial count (TBC), Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and gram-negative bacteria (GNB). Reduction (RED) of each bacterial group was defined as the difference in the number of bacteria measured before and after udder preparation. Before udder preparation, Staphylococcus spp. (15,036 cfu/mL) and Streptococcus spp. (12,621 cfu/mL) were the most numerous microflora. Gram-negative bacteria were less numerous (1,538 cfu/mL). A significant treatment by farm interaction was identified for RED of all bacterial counts. Compared with teats prepared using TS, teats prepared using CONV preparation had greater RED of TBC on 3 farms, of Streptococcus spp. on 2 farms, and of Staphylococcus spp. on 1 farm. On all other farms, RED in TBC, Streptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. did not differ based on teat preparation method. Use of TS resulted in greater RED of GNB of teats on 3 farms, but RED in GNB was greater for teats cleaned by CONV on 1 farm; for the other 6 farms, RED of GNB did not differ between methods. For all bacterial counts, an effect of chlorine dioxide concentration used in the teat scrubber was observed. Results from this study suggest both CONV and TS can effectively reduce bacterial counts, but farm conditions and management practices can have a significant effect on the effectiveness of teat disinfection.","author":[{"family":"Baumberger","given":"C."},{"family":"Guarín","given":"J.F."},{"family":"Ruegg","given":"P.L."}],"citation-key":"Baumberger2016a","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2015-10003","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"2915-2929","PMID":"26898276","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Effect of 2 different premilking teat sanitation routines on reduction of bacterial counts on teat skin of cows on commercial dairy farms","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030216001533","volume":"99"},

Our previous work showed that CLA (mixture of isomers) markedly reduced milk fat synthesis. In this study, our objective was to evaluate the effects of specific CLA isomers. Multiparous Holstein cows were used in a 3x3 Latin square design, and treatments were 4-day abomasal infusions of 1) skim milk (control), 2) 9,11 CLA supplement, and 3) 10,12 CLA supplement. CLA supplements provided 10 g/day of the specific CLA isomer (cis-9,trans-11 or trans-10,cis-12). Treatments had no effect on intake, milk yield, or milk protein yield. Only the 10,12 CLA supplement affected milk fat, causing a 42 and 44% reduction in milk fat percentage and yield, respectively. Milk fat composition revealed that de novo synthesized fatty acids were extensively reduced.

  {"id":"Baumgard2001","abstract":"Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) supplements containing a variety of isomers reduce milk fat yield. We have recently identified trans-10, cis-12 CLA as the isomer responsible for inhibiting milk fat synthesis in dairy cows. Our objectives were to determine milk fat yield and fatty acid composition responses to different doses of trans-10, cis-12 CLA. Multiparous Holstein cows (n = 4) were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square design. Treatments consisted of a 5-d abomasal infusion of four doses of trans-10, cis-12 CLA, i.e., 0.0, 3.5, 7.0 and 14.0 g/d. Milk fat yield was decreased 25, 33, and 50%, and milk fat concentration was reduced 24, 37 and 46% when cows received 3.5, 7.0 and 14.0 g/d of trans-10, cis-12 CLA, respectively. Feed intake, milk yield, and milk protein content and yield were unaffected by treatment. Milk fatty acid composition revealed that de novo synthesized fatty acids (short and medium chain) were extensively reduced when cows received the two highest doses, but at the low dose (3.5 g/d), decreases in de novo synthesized fatty acids and preformed fatty acids were similar. Changes in milk fatty acid composition also demonstrated that (9)-desaturase activity was inhibited at the two high doses of trans-10, cis-12 CLA, but was unaffected by the low dose. Results indicate minimal quantities of trans-10, cis-12 CLA (0.016% of dietary dry matter) markedly inhibited milk fat synthesis (25% reduction) and that a curvilinear reduction in milk fat yield occurred with increasing quantities of trans-10, cis-12 CLA.","author":[{"family":"Baumgard","given":"L H"},{"family":"Sangster","given":"J K"},{"family":"Bauman","given":"D E"}],"citation-key":"Baumgard2001","container-title":"The Journal of nutrition","ISSN":"0022-3166","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",6]]},"page":"1764-9","PMID":"11385065","title":"Milk fat synthesis in dairy cows is progressively reduced by increasing supplemental amounts of trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA).","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11385065","volume":"131"},

  {"id":"Beauchemin2008","abstract":"Four multiparous Holstein cows in midlactation were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square to evaluate whether source of forage influenced salivary secretion during eating in lactating dairy cows. The forages were allocated separately from the pelleted concentrates. Cows were offered 1 of 4 forages each period: barley silage, alfalfa silage, long-stemmed alfalfa hay, or chopped barley straw. Saliva secretion was measured during the morning meal by collecting masticates through the rumen cannula at the cardia of each cow. Rate of salivation (213 g/min) was not affected by forage source. However, the forage sources differed in eating rate (g of DM/min), which led to differences in ensalivation of forages (g of saliva/g of DM and g of saliva/g of NDF). On the basis of DM, ensalivation (g of saliva/g of DM) was greatest for straw (7.23) and similar for barley silage, alfalfa silage, and alfalfa hay (4.15, 3.40, and 4.34 g/g of DM, respectively). Higher ensalivation of straw could be accounted for by its higher neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content; ensalivation of NDF (g of saliva/g of NDF) was actually greatest for long-stemmed alfalfa hay (12.4) and similar for the other chopped forages (8.9). Cows consumed concentrate about 3 to 12 times faster than the various forages (DM basis), and ensalivation of concentrate was much lower (1.12 g of saliva/g of DM) than for forages. Feed characteristics such as particle size, DM, and NDF content affect salivary output during eating by affecting the eating rate. Slower eating rate and greater time spent eating may help prevent ruminal acidosis by increasing the total daily salivary secretion in dairy cows.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Beauchemin","given":"K","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Eriksen","given":"L"},{"family":"Nørgaard","given":"P"},{"family":"Rode","given":"L M"}],"citation-key":"Beauchemin2008","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2007-0726","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",5]]},"page":"2077-81","PMID":"18420637","title":"Short communication: salivary secretion during meals in lactating dairy cattle.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18420637","volume":"91"},

Despite a large body of research, few practical and cost-effective farm-level interventions have been identified. In this study, a randomized controlled trial was con- ducted to assess the effect of reducing the level of water in automatically refilling water- troughs on fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in feedlot cattle. Pens in a feedlot in the Texas Panhandle were randomly allocated as control (total number: 17) or intervention (total num- ber: 18) pens. Fecal samples (2,759 in total) were collected both at baseline and three weeks after the intervention, and tested for the presence of E. coli O157:H7 using immuno- magnetic bead separation and selective culture. There was a strong statistical association between sampling date and the likelihood of a fecal sample testing positive for E. coli O157: H7. Pen was also a strong predictor of fecal prevalence. Despite accounting for this high level of clustering, a statistically significant association between reduced water levels in the trough and increased prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 in the feces was observed (Odds Ratio = 1.6; 95% Confidence Interval: 1.2–2.0; Likelihood Ratio Test: p = 0.02). This is the first time that such an association has been reported, and suggests that increasing water- trough levels may be effective in reducing shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in cattle feces, although further work would be needed to test this hypothesis. Controlling E. coli O157:H7 fecal shedding at the pre-harvest level may lead to a reduced burden of human foodborne ill- ness attributed to this pathogen in beef.","author":[{"family":"Beauvais","given":"Wendy"},{"family":"Gart","given":"Elena V"},{"family":"Bean","given":"Melissa"},{"family":"Blanco","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Wilsey","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Mcwhinney","given":"Kallie"},{"family":"Bryan","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Krath","given":"Mary"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Ching-yuan"},{"family":"Manriquez","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Paudyal","given":"Sushil"},{"family":"Bryan","given":"Kelsey"},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Samantha"},{"family":"Cook","given":"Peter W"},{"family":"Lahodny","given":"Glenn"},{"family":"Baumgarten","given":"Karina"},{"family":"Gautam","given":"Raju"},{"family":"Nightingale","given":"Kendra"},{"family":"Lawhon","given":"D"},{"family":"Pinedo","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"Ivanek","given":"Renata"}],"citation-key":"beauvais2018","container-title":"Plos One","ISBN":"1111111111","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"1-21","title":"The prevalence of Escherichia coli O157 : H7 fecal shedding in feedlot pens is affected by the water-to-cattle ratio : A randomized controlled trial","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0192149","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"Beaver2021","abstract":"Modern freestall barns for dairy cattle have been constructed with considerations for dairy cow cleanliness; partitions and other stall features such as neck rails are designed to reduce manure contamination of bedding and decrease farm labor. However, cows prefer to lie in more open spaces, including on bedded packs and pasture. We created an “alternative” housing area by modifying a traditional freestall pen and including flexible partitions to create larger lying areas. We assessed cattle lying behaviour, including lying postures, in this alternative pen (ALT) compared to an open pack (OP) and freestalls (FS) with different stocking densities. We also assessed levels of manure contamination across systems. Cleanliness was highest in FS, but ALT provided substantial improvement compared to OP. Cattle spent more time lying down in OP and ALT compared to FS. There were few differences in postures (such as lying with limbs outstretched) between OP and ALT, but cows in both of these systems more often lay in extended positions compared to when they were housed in FS. Housing in OP and ALT was associated with reduced perching for cows with high body weight; perching has been linked to an increased prevalence of both hoof lesions and lameness. Thus, alternative lying areas can offer a solution for producers seeking to provide cattle with the advantages of a more open lying area, while improving hygiene relative to an open pack.","author":[{"family":"Beaver","given":"Annabelle"},{"family":"Strazhnik","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Keyserlingk","given":"Marina A.G.","non-dropping-particle":"von"},{"family":"Weary","given":"Daniel M."}],"citation-key":"Beaver2021","container-title":"Animals","DOI":"10.3390/ani11061711","ISSN":"20762615","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"title":"The freestall reimagined: Effects on stall hygiene and space usage in dairy cattle","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

This paper aims to elucidate the effects of supplementing a specific essential oils blend Agolin® Ruminant on the productivity of dairy cows in comparison to non-treated animals. A total of 23 in vivo studies were identified in which Agolin was supplemented at 1 g/d per cow; then a meta-analysis was performed to determine the response ratio on milk yield, rumen fermentation, methane emissions and health. Results indicated that an adaptation period of at least 4 weeks of treatment is required. Whereas short-term studies showed minor and inconsistent effects of Agolin, long-term studies (>4 weeks of treatment) revealed that Agolin supplementation increases milk yield (+3.6%), fat and protein corrected milk (+4.1%) and feed efficiency (+4.4%) without further changes in milk composition and feed intake. Long-term treatment also decreased methane production per day (−8.8%), per dry matter intake (−12.9%) and per fat and protein corrected milk yield (−9.9%) without changes in rumen fermentation pattern. In conclusion, despite the mode of action is still unclear and the small number of studies considered, these findings show that Agolin represents an encouraging alternative to improve productivity in dairy cows.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Belanche","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Newbold","given":"Charles J."},{"family":"Morgavi","given":"Diego P."},{"family":"Bach","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Zweifel","given":"Beatrice"},{"family":"Yáñez-Ruiz","given":"David R."}],"citation-key":"belanche2020","container-title":"Animals","DOI":"10.3390/ani10040620","ISSN":"2076-2615","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"4","page":"620","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"A Meta-analysis Describing the Effects of the Essential oils Blend Agolin Ruminant on Performance, Rumen Fermentation and Methane Emissions in Dairy Cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/4/620","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"Bell2000","abstract":"Empirical evidence suggests that prolonged underfeeding of protein to late-pregnant dry cows can have modest negative carry-over effects on milk volume and/or protein yield during early lactation, and may also cause increased incidence of metabolic diseases associated with fatty liver. However, assessment of requirements is hampered by lack of information on relationships between dietary intake of crude protein (N x 6.25) and metabolizable protein supply during late pregnancy, and by incomplete understanding of the quantitative metabolism of amino acids in maternal and conceptus tissues. Inability of the postparturient cow to consume sufficient protein to meet mammary and extra-mammary amino acid requirements, including a significant demand for hepatic gluconeogenesis, necessitates a substantial, albeit transient, mobilization of tissue protein during the first 2 weeks of lactation. Ultimately, much of this mobilized protein appears to be derived from peripheral tissues, especially skeletal muscle and, to a lesser extent, skin, through suppression of tissue protein synthesis, and possibly increased proteolysis. In the shorter term, soon after calving, it is likely that amino acids required for hepatic glucose synthesis are diverted from high rates of synthesis of splanchnic tissue and export proteins, including serum albumin. The prevailing endocrine milieu of the periparturient cow, including major reductions in plasma levels of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I, together with insulin resistance in peripheral tissues, must permissively facilitate, if not actively promote, net mobilization of amino acids from these tissues.","author":[{"family":"Bell","given":"Alan W."},{"family":"Burhans","given":"Winfield S."},{"family":"Overton","given":"Thomas R."}],"citation-key":"Bell2000","container-title":"Proceedings of the Nutrition Society","DOI":"10.1017/S0029665100000148","ISBN":"0029-6651 (Print)\\r0029-6651 (Linking)","ISSN":"00296651","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]},"page":"119-126","PMID":"10828181","title":"Protein nutrition in late pregnancy, maternal protein reserves and lactation performance in dairy cows","type":"article-journal","volume":"59"},

Milk fat content was lower for cows fed MO than for cows fed diets without MO (3.8 vs. 4.1%). The reduced milk fat concentration in cows fed MO was associated with a higher level of trans-10 18:1, a potent inhibitor of milk fat synthesis. Milk urea nitrogen concentration was increased by MO supplementation, but this effect was not apparent when MO was fed in combination with EO (interaction EO x MO).

Total mixed rations containing either AS or CS as the sole forage source were balanced to be isocaloric and isonitrogenous. In general, no interactions between MEO addition and silage source were observed. Except for ruminal pH and milk lactose content, which were increased by MEO supplementation, no changes attributable to the administration of MEO were observed for feed intake, nutrient digestibility, end-products of ruminal fermentation, microbial counts, and milk performance. Dry matter intake and milk production were not affected by replacing AS with CS in the diet. However, cows fed CS-based diets produced milk with lower fat and higher protein and urea N concentrations than cows fed AS-based diets. Replacing AS with CS increased the concentration of NH(3)-N and reduced the acetate-to-propionate ratio in ruminal fluid. Total viable bacteria, cellulolytic bacteria, and protozoa were not influenced by MEO supplementation, but the total viable bacteria count was higher with CS- than with AS-based diets. The apparent digestibility of crude protein did not differ between the AS and CS treatments, but digestibilities of neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber were lower when cows were fed CS-based diets than when they were fed AS-based diets. Duodenal bacterial N flow, estimated using urinary purine derivatives and the amount of N retained, increased in cows fed CS-based diets compared with those fed AS-based diets. Feeding cows AS increased the milk fat contents of cis-9, trans-11 18:2 (conjugated linoleic acid) and 18:3 (n-3 fatty acid) compared with feeding cows CS.

  {"id":"benedetInvitedReviewVhydroxybutyrate2019","abstract":"Hyperketonemia (HYK) is one of the most frequent and costly metabolic disorders in high-producing dairy cows and its diagnosis is based on β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentration in blood. In the last 10 years, the number of papers that have dealt with the impact of elevated BHB levels in dairy cattle has increased. Therefore, this paper reviewed the recent literature on BHB concentration in blood and milk, and its relationships with dairy cow health and performance, and farm profitability. Most studies applied the threshold of 1.2 mmol/l of BHB concentration in blood to indicate HYK; several authors considered BHB concentrations between 1.2 and 2.9 mmol/l as subclinical ketosis, and values ≥3.0 mmol/l as clinical ketosis. Results on HYK frequency (prevalence and incidence) and cow performance varied according to parity and days in milk, being greater in multiparous than in primiparous cows, and in the first 2 weeks of lactation than in later stages. Hyperketonemia has been associated with greater milk fat content, fat-to-protein ratio and energy-corrected milk, and lower protein and urea nitrogen in milk. The relationships with milk yield and somatic cell count are still controversial. In general, HYK impairs health of dairy cows by increasing the risk of the onset of other early lactation diseases, and it negatively affects reproductive performance. The economic cost of HYK is mainly due to impaired reproductive performance and milk loss. From a genetic point of view, results from the literature suggested the feasibility of selecting cows with low susceptibility to HYK. The present review highlights that milk is the most promising matrix to identify HYK, because it is easy to sample and allows a complete screening of the herd through BHB concentration predicted using mid-IR spectroscopy during routine milk recording. Further research is needed to validate accurate and convenient methods to discriminate between cows in risk of HYK and healthy animals in field conditions and to support farmers to achieve an early detection and minimise the economic losses.","author":[{"family":"Benedet","given":"A."},{"family":"Manuelian","given":"C.

METHOD OF STUDY: To study the association between RP and different MHC class I compatibilities between calf-dam-granddam combinations, massively parallel pyrosequencing was used to determine the MHC class I haplotypes of cows with and without RP. RESULTS: Two-way calf to dam MHC class I compatibility gave a high risk for RP. There was a tendency for a higher risk for RP with calf to dam MHC class I compatibility. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that in two-way compatible pregnancies, the maternal immune system fails to reject the fetal membranes, and the fetal immune system does not mount an immune response against maternal MHC class I antigens that could influence the immune-mediated rejection of the fetal membranes by the maternal immune system. The lack of immune-mediated rejection of the fetal membranes by the maternal immune system increases the risk of occurrence of RP.","author":[{"family":"Benedictus","given":"Lindert"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Aaron J."},{"family":"Jorritsma","given":"Ruurd"},{"family":"Davies","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Koets","given":"Ad P."}],"citation-key":"Benedictus2012","container-title":"American Journal of Reproductive Immunology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-0897.2011.01085.x","ISSN":"10467408","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"224-230","PMID":"22035222","title":"Two-Way Calf to Dam Major Histocompatibility Class I Compatibility Increases Risk for Retained Placenta in Cattle","type":"article-journal","volume":"67"},

The main challenge of genomic breeding value estimation is the estimation of many effects from a limited number of observations. Bayesian methods have been proposed to successfully cope with these challenges. As an alternative class of models, non- and semiparametric models were recently introduced. The present study investigated the ability of nonparametric additive regression models to predict genomic breeding values. The genotypes were modelled for each marker or pair of flanking markers (i.e. the predictors) separately. The nonparametric functions for the predictors were estimated simultaneously using additive model theory, applying a binomial kernel. The optimal degree of smoothing was determined by bootstrapping. A mutation-drift-balance simulation was carried out. The breeding values of the last generation (genotyped) was predicted using data from the next last generation (genotyped and phenotyped). The results show moderate to high accuracies of the predicted breeding values.

Study cows were observed for clinical disease up to 35. d postcalving. Multivariate analysis (generalized estimating equation logistic regression) was performed to determine country, farm, management, feed, and cow factors associated with ketosis and to determine associations between ketosis and fresh cow diseases. Thirty-nine percent of the cows were classified as having ketosis. The herd average of ketosis was 43% in Germany, 53% in France, 31% in Italy, 46% in the Netherlands, and 31% in the United Kingdom. Of the 131 farms, 112 (85%) had 25% or more of their fresh cows resulting as positive for ketosis. Clinical ketosis was not reported in most farms and the highest level of clinical ketosis reported was 23%. The risks of ketosis were significantly lower in Italy and the United Kingdom compared with France, the Netherlands, and Germany. Larger herd size was associated with a decreased risk of ketosis. The farms that fed partially mixed rations had 1.5 times higher odds of ketosis than those that fed total mixed rations. Cows that calved in April to June had the highest odds of ketosis, with about twice as high odds compared with cows that calved in July to September.

Acid detergent fiber (ADF) concentration was higher and in vitro true dry matter (DM) digestibility (IVTDMD) was lower for the variety predicted to have average digestibility.

When silages were fed to 32 Holstein cows in a 5-wk randomized design trial, DM intake, milk yield, and milk composition were similar. There was an interaction between variety and cutting height for DM intake and total tract apparent digestibility of DM, crude protein, and neutral detergent fiber because of lower intake and digestibility for the diets containing either the high cut, average quality variety or low cut, higher quality variety.

The aim was to assess the effect of one feature of free-stall design, the position of the neck rail, testing the prediction that cows will be more likely to become lame if using pens with the neck rail positioned such that it prevents standing fully inside the stall. Cows (n=32) were housed in 8 pens. Treatments were tested using a crossover design; treatments were allocated alternately to pens at the beginning of the experiment and switched halfway through the 10-wk experiment. Cows spent 27+or-3 min/d standing with all 4 feet in stalls with less restrictive neck rails. In contrast, cows averaged just 1+or-3 min/d when the neck rail was positioned restrictively. Cows spent less time standing with only the front 2 feet in the stall with less restrictive neck rails (33 vs. 49+or-6 min/d). Gait scores improved when cows were kept in the less restrictive stalls and worsened when cows were kept in pens with the restrictive neck rail (median score 2.5 vs. 3.5 after 5 wk on treatment). Of 13 new cases of lameness, 11 occurred in pens with the restrictive neck-rail position. Similarly, of the 16 new cases of sole lesions, 15 occurred during the period when cows were housed in pens with a restrictive neck rail. Stalls with the neck rail positioned less restrictively had higher contamination scores than stalls with the restrictive neck rails (3.7 vs. 0.4+or-0.2), and cows using those stalls had dirtier udders and longer teat-cleaning times (8.3 vs. 7.0+or-0.2 min for 12 cows).

All forage was ensiled in plastic bags and stored until the production trial began. Silages contained (dry matter basis) 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, and 9.5% crude protein; 39.0, 38.3, 54.2, and 55.1% neutral detergent fiber; and 3.6, 2.8. 7.7, and 7.8% acid detergent lignin, for CSS, CSF, FSS, and FSF, respectively. Forty-eight mid-lactation Holstein cows (153.5±37.2d in milk, 35.7±6.2kg/d of milk, 3.2±0.6% fat, 611.8±67.0kg of body weight, and 2.96±0.09 body condition score) were assigned randomly to 1 of the 4diets differing in forage source. Cows were individually fed experimental diets once daily behind Calan doors for 5wk. Diets were formulated to contain 38.7% of the experimental forages and balanced to provide equal concentrations of protein, fiber, and energy. No differences were observed in dry matter intake and yields of milk and components, but milk fat percentage was lower for CSS and CSF compared with FSS and FSF, being 3.20, 2.91, 3.42, and 3.53%, respectively. Milk lactose percentage was lower for CSS compared with CSF but was not different from FSS or FSF. Concentrations of milk urea nitrogen were lower for CSS and CSF compared with FSS and FSF (10.6, 13.4, 14.9, and 15.3mg/dL, respectively). No differences were observed in body weight or body condition score change during the trial. Results of this trial suggest that silage produced from brachytic forage sorghum, as either the first or the ratoon crop, can support similar intake and performance as diets based on corn silage.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Bernard","given":"J.K."},{"family":"Tao","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"bernardShortCommunicationProduction2015","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2015-9716","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,1]]},"page":"8994-9000","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Short communication: Production response of lactating dairy cows to brachytic forage sorghum silage compared with corn silage from first or second harvest","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030215007249","volume":"98"},

  {"id":"Bertoni2010","abstract":"Speaking in terms of the general relationship between nutrition and reproduction, many different aspects are more or less involved depending on geographical areas, species, production systems, technological levels etc. There are deficiency conditions: energy, proteins, vitamins and minerals; but also some excesses (namely protein and few minerals) or toxic substances such as micotoxins or plant compounds (i.e. phyto-oestrogens). Their relevance is different in the intensive systems for better feeds and relative easiness to create appropriate diets. Nevertheless, intensification does not reduce the nutritional risks for livestock reproduction for several reasons: namely, a suspected higher susceptibility of high genetic merit cows to the usual stresses. There is also a new risk: metabolic stress (e.g. negative energy balance). The latter is particularly relevant when early lactation and new pregnancy are close (as in dairy cows), however, of great importance are also oxidative stress and disease stress (pro-inflammatory cytokines). In dairy cows, inflammatory phenomena around calving - when an immune response occurs in spite of clinical symptoms are missing - are significantly related to a lower pregnancy rate. A possible explanation can be seen in the pro-inflammatory cytokines, which modify liver synthesis and seem to impair energy balance thereby reducing feed intake and increasing energy expenditure. This suggests that in order to improve fertility not only better feeding mecahnisms, but any husbandry tool that can reduce diseases and health disorders are needed.","author":[{"family":"Bertoni","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Trevisi","given":"Erminio"},{"family":"Lombardelli","given":"Rosanna"}],"citation-key":"Bertoni2010","container-title":"Italian Journal of Animal Science","DOI":"10.4081/ijas.2009.491","ISBN":"1594-4077","ISSN":"1594-4077","issue":"November","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"page":"491-518","title":"Some new aspects of nutrition, health conditions and fertility of intensively reared dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.4081/ijas.2009.491","volume":"8"},

Fat supplements were 1) sunflower oil (80% cis 18:1), 2) Ca salt of transoctadecenoic acids (57% trans 18:1), 3) Ca salt of vegetable oils (30% 18:2), and 4) linseed oil (56% 18:3 and 16% 18:2). Fats were fed at 1.35% of dietary dry matter beginning at 5 wk prior to expected calving date and at 1.5% (oils) and 1.75% (Ca salts) of dietary dry matter for 15 wk after parturition. Four days following a programmed induced ovulation, 5 transvaginal oocyte aspirations were performed 3 or 4 d apart. Three days after the last aspiration, PGF2alpha was injected, followed 3 d later by a GnRH injection and a timed artificial insemination (d 0) 16 to 20 h later. For the first 4 aspirations, oocytes grading 1 or 2 were used for in vitro embryo production. Total cell number and the proportion of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive blastomeres were analyzed at d 8. At the fifth aspiration, the occurrence of metaphase II, group II caspase activity, and TUNEL labeling were determined after oocyte maturation. A total of 1,011 oocytes were collected. The proportion of oocytes with high caspase activity was greater for grade 3 compared with grades 1 and 2 (37.5 vs. 1.54 and 1.61%). Feeding polyunsaturated fatty acids, as compared with monosaturated fatty acids, failed to affect oocyte quality, as demonstrated by subsequent embryo development.

  {"id":"Bittar2014","abstract":"The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effect of GnRH early postpartum on induction of ovulation, uterine health, and fertility in dairy cows. Holstein cows without a corpus luteum (CL) at 17±3 DIM were assigned randomly to receive i.m. GnRH (n=245) at 17±3 and 20±3 DIM or remain as controls (n=245). Ovaries were scanned by ultrasonography twice weekly totaling 4 examinations. Ovulation was characterized by the appearance of a CL ≥20mm at any ultrasound or CL <20mm in 2 consecutive examinations. Clinical and cytological endometritis were diagnosed at 35 DIM. Compared with control, GnRH increased ovulation up to 3.5d after the last treatment (78.7 vs. 45.0%) and did not affect the prevalence of clinical endometritis (23.9 vs. 18.6%) or cytological endometritis (30.9 vs. 32.8%). Prevalence of clinical endometritis increased in cows that had calving problems (32.6 vs. 15.9%) and metritis (40.6 vs. 15.8%). Metritis increased prevalence of cytological endometritis (50.7 vs. 23.5%). Treatment with GnRH did not affect pregnancy per artificial insemination at 32 (37.6 vs. 38.6%) or 74d after artificial insemination (35.0 vs. 31.5%), but reduced pregnancy loss (6.8 vs. 18.1%). No overall effect of GnRH treatment on hazard of pregnancy was observed; however, an interaction between GnRH treatment and ovulation showed that GnRH-treated cows that ovulated had increased hazard of pregnancy by 300 DIM compared with GnRH-treated and control cows that did not ovulate (hazard ratio=2.0 and 1.3, respectively), but similar to control cows that ovulated (hazard ratio=1.1).

  {"id":"Bjerre-Harpøth2014","abstract":"The aim of the experiment was to investigate the effects of manipulating body condition score (BCS) during the dry period of over-conditioned and under-conditioned cows using two dry period diets with high and low energy content, respectively. The cows' ability to cope with the transition from pregnancy to lactation was evaluated by production parameters and several plasma and liver variables. Furthermore, the outcome of the experiment was used to see the potential of using BCS at dry off as a guiding principle in dry cow feeding management.A complete randomized design was used with a two by two factorial arrangement of treatments. Fifty-one Holstein dairy cows participated in the trial from 20 weeks before expected calving to eight weeks postpartum. With the aim to obtain two groups of cows with high or low BCS at dry off, the cows were divided into two groups in late lactation and assigned to one of two different late lactation diets: High-energy diet (HiLate, net energy for lactation (NEL)=6.76MJ) or low-energy diet (LoLate, NEL=5.73MJ). At dry off, each group was divided and assigned to one of two dry period diets: High-energy diet (HiDry, NEL=6.86MJ) or low-energy diet (LoDry, NEL=4.96MJ). Thus, from dry off the cows were divided into four groups (HiHi, HiLo, LoHi and LoLo). After parturition, all cows received the same lactation diet (NEL=6.73MJ).Irrespective of BCS at dry off, it was demonstrated that cows fed the LoDry diet were physiologically healthier and in less risk of developing metabolic diseases in early lactation, compared to cows with the same late lactation background fed the HiDry diet. This result was established despite the fact that energy intake and milk production in early lactation was not different between the groups with the same BCS at dry off.In early lactation, there was a lower concentration of plasma non-esterified fatty acids and plasma β-hydroxybutyrate and a numeric higher concentration of plasma glucose in the HiLo group compared with the HiHi group. The difference between the LoHi group and the LoLo group showed the same trends. The milk productions in early lactation were related to the treatments in late lactation, irrespective of the dry period feeding treatments hence, implying the importance of acknowledging carry-over effects from the energy intake in the previous lactation.","author":[{"family":"Bjerre-Harpøth","given":"Vibeke"},{"family":"Larsen","given":"Mogens"},{"family":"Friggens","given":"Nicolas C."},{"family":"Larsen","given":"Torben"},{"family":"Weisbjerg","given":"Martin Riis"},{"family":"Damgaard","given":"Birthe Marie"}],"citation-key":"Bjerre-Harpøth2014","container-title":"Livestock Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.livsci.2014.08.006","ISSN":"18711413","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"60-75","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of dietary energy supply to dry Holstein cows with high or low body condition score at dry off on production and metabolism in early lactation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2014.08.006","volume":"168"},
  {"id":"Bjerre-Harpoth2016","abstract":"The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of propylene glycol (PG) allocation on concentrations of milk metabolites with potential use as indicators of glucogenic status in high yielding postpartum dairy cows. At time of calving, nine ruminally cannulated Holstein cows were randomly assigned to ruminal dosing of 500 g/d tap water (CON, n = 4) or 500 g/d PG (PPG, n = 5). The PG was given with the morning feeding week 1-4 postpartum (treatment period) and cows were further followed during week 5-8 postpartum (follow-up period). All cows were fed the same postpartum diet. Milk samples were obtained at each milking (3 times/d) in the treatment period, and at morning milking during the follow-up period. Weekly blood samples were obtained from -4 to +8 weeks relative to calving and daily blood samples from -7 until +7 d relative to calving. The main effect of PG allocation was an increased glucogenic status, e.g. visualised by a prompt marked increase in blood fructosamine. During the treatment period, milk concentration of free glucose tended to be greater, whereas milk concentrations of isocitrate and BHBA were lower for PPG compared with CON. It is proposed that the ratio between free glucose and isocitrate in milk may be a potential biomarker for glucogenic status in the vulnerable early postpartum period. We will pursue this issue in the future.","author":[{"family":"Bjerre-Harpoth","given":"Vibeke"},{"family":"Storm","given":"Adam C."},{"family":"Vestergaard","given":"Mogens"},{"family":"Larsen","given":"Mogens"},{"family":"Larsen","given":"Torben"}],"citation-key":"Bjerre-Harpoth2016","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Research","DOI":"10.1017/S0022029916000145","ISSN":"14697629","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"156-164","PMID":"27032705","title":"Effect of postpartum propylene glycol allocation to over-conditioned Holstein cows on concentrations of milk metabolites","type":"article-journal","volume":"83"},
  {"id":"Bjørnstad2004a","abstract":"The utility of a relatively new multivariate method, bi-linear modelling by cross-validated partial least squares regression (PLSR), was investigated in the analysis of QTL. The distinguishing feature of PLSR is to reveal reliable covariance structures in data of different types with regard to the same set objects. Two matrices X (here: genetic markers) and Y (here: phenotypes) are interactively decomposed into latent variables (PLS components, or PCs) in a way which facilitates statistically reliable and graphically interpretable model building. Natural collinearities between input variables are utilized actively to stabilise the modelling, instead of being treated as a statistical problem. The importance of cross-validation/jack-knifing as an intuitively appealing way to avoid overfitting, is emphasized. Two datasets from chromosomal mapping studies of different complexity were chosen for illustration (QTL for tomato yield and for oat heading date). Results from PLSR analysis were compared to published results and to results using the package PLABQTL in these data sets. In all cases PLSR gave at least similar explained validation variances as the reported studies. An attractive feature is that PLSR allows the analysis of several traits/replicates in one analysis, and the direct visual identification of individuals with desirable marker genotypes. It is suggested that PLSR may be useful in structural and functional genomics and in marker assisted selection, particularly in cases with limited number of objects.","author":[{"family":"Bjørnstad","given":"Asmund"},{"family":"Westad","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Martens","given":"Harald"}],"citation-key":"Bjørnstad2004a","container-title":"Hereditas","DOI":"10.1111/j.1601-5223.2004.01816.x","ISSN":"0018-0661","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",1]]},"page":"149-65","PMID":"15660976","title":"Analysis of genetic marker-phenotype relationships by jack-knifed partial least squares regression (PLSR).","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15660976","volume":"141"},

Expression of resistance differed widely between replicated tests. AFLP, SSR and RFLP markers were used to develop chromosome maps. Results have been analysed using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and interval mapping. In PLSR the major covariance structures or 'latent variables' between X (markers) and Y (isolates, tests) are modelled as principal components and their optimal number determined by cross-validation. In 'Steudelli' two QTL were detected, one on each of chromosomes 3H and 7H, in 4 out of 5 tests, while in 'Jet' only one (different) allele at the 3H locus was found. The validated R(2) varied between 11.0% and 64.9% in the replicated tests with '4004'.With isolate 'WRS1872' the 7H locus and another 3H locus were detected. By interval mapping the QTL detected were less stable and generally gave lower R(2) values than PLSR. PLSR does not depend on maps, but interval mapping based on values predicted by PLSR had R(2) around 90%.

  {"id":"Boerman2015","abstract":"The objective of this analysis was to examine the intestinal digestibility of individual long-chain fatty acids (FA) in lactating dairy cows. Available data were collated from 15 publications containing 61 treatments, which reported total and individual FA duodenal flows and calculations of intestinal digestibility. All studies involved lactating dairy cows, and estimates of digestibility were based on measurements either between the duodenum and ileum (18 treatments) or between the duodenum and feces (43 treatments). Fatty acid digestibility was calculated for C16:0, C18:0, C18:1 (cis and trans isomers), C18:2, and C18:3. Digestibility of C18:0 was lower than for C18:1 and C18:3, with no difference in digestibility between saturated FA (C16:0 and C18:0). We weighted the studies by the reciprocal of the variance to generate best-fit equations to predict individual FA digestibility based on duodenal flow of FA and dietary independent variables. The flow of C18:0 negatively affected the digestibility of C18:0 and was also included in the best-fit equations for all other 18-carbon FA using duodenal flow characteristics. The type of fat supplemented had an effect on digestibility of individual FA, with whole seeds having reduced digestibility. Our meta-analysis results showed minimal differences in the digestibility of individual FA. However, C18:0 flow through the duodenum had a negative effect on the digestibility of several individual FA, with the largest negative effect on C18:0 digestibility. The mechanisms that reduce C18:0 absorption at high concentrations are unknown and warrant further investigation.","author":[{"family":"Boerman","given":"J P"},{"family":"Firkins","given":"J L"},{"family":"Lock","given":"A L"},{"family":"St-Pierre","given":"N R"},{"family":"Lock","given":"A L"}],"citation-key":"Boerman2015","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2015-9592","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"8889-903","PMID":"26409970","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Intestinal digestibility of long-chain fatty acids in lactating dairy cows: A meta-analysis and meta-regression.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-9592%5Cnhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030215006827","volume":"98"},
  {"id":"Boguhn2006","abstract":"The goal of this study was to identify dietary factors that affect fermentation and efficiency of microbial crude protein (CP(M)) synthesis in the rumen in vitro. We used 16 total mixed, dairy cow rations with known digestibilities that varied in ingredient composition and nutrient content. Each ration was incubated in a Rusitec (n = 3) for 15 d, and fermentation of different fractions was assessed. Observed extents of fermentation in 24 h were 35 to 47% for organic matter, 25 to 60% for crude protein, 3 to 28% for neutral detergent fiber, and 31 to 45% for gross energy. Organic matter fermentation depended on the content of crude protein and neutral detergent fiber in the ration. We studied net synthesis of CP(M) using an 15N dilution technique and found that 7 d of continuous 15N application are needed to achieve an 15N enrichment plateau in the N of isolated microbes in this type of study. The efficiency of CP(M) synthesis was 141 to 286 g/kg of fermented organic matter or 4.9 to 11.1 g/MJ of metabolizable energy, and these ranges agree with those found in the literature. Multiple regressions to predict the efficiency of CP(M) synthesis by diet data showed that crude protein was the only dietary chemical fraction that had a significant effect. Fat content and the inclusion rate of corn silage in the ration also tended to improve efficiency. We suggest that microbial need for preformed amino acids may explain the crude protein effect. A large part of the variation in efficiency of microbial activity still remains unexplained.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Boguhn","given":"J"},{"family":"Kluth","given":"H"},{"family":"Rodehutscord","given":"M"}],"citation-key":"Boguhn2006","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72225-1","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",5]]},"page":"1580-91","PMID":"16606728","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of total mixed ration composition on fermentation and efficiency of ruminal microbial crude protein synthesis in vitro.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16606728","volume":"89"},

This study was conducted from January 2018 to December 2020 on a commercial dairy farm in Germany, milking approximately 2,500 Holstein cows. Dairy personnel recorded colostrum quantity (n = 7,562) and evaluated colostrum quality in a subsample of animals (n = 2,600) using a digital Brix refractometer. Generalized linear mixed models were constructed to evaluate the association of management-related factors and colostrum quantity and quality. Models were run separately for primiparous or multiparous cows. The outcome variable was either colostrum quantity (kg) or quality (% Brix). Average colostrum quantity was 4.0 ± 2.5 kg, 5.1 ± 3.4 kg, and 5.5 ± 3.5 kg for cows in lactation 1, 2, and ≥3, respectively. In primiparous cows (n = 2,351), colostrum quantity was affected by month of calving (greatest in April = 4.1 kg, and lowest in November = 3.2 kg), sex of the calf (female singleton = 3.50 ± 0.26 kg; male singleton = 3.76 ± 0.27 kg; twins = 2.97 ± 0.66 kg), stillbirth (stillbirth = 3.14 ± 0.39 kg; no stillbirth = 3.68 ± 0.31 kg).

Lactating Holstein cows, on 3 commercial dairies, were fed either an early-lactation ration (CON) or a ration that was similar in protein, energy, and fat content but that included FLX (0.85 kg of DM/cow per day). Within each dairy, cows were allocated alternately to breeding pens upon leaving the fresh pen (approximately 10 ± 5 d postpartum). Pens (n = 4 to 5 pens/dairy) were randomized to treatment (n = 2 to 3 pens/treatment per dairy). Pen (CON, n = 6; FLX, n = 7) was considered the experimental unit and data were analyzed as a split plot with pen as the whole-plot error term. Cows fed FLX had greater (P ≤ 0.06) proportions of cis-9, trans-11 C18:2, C18:3n-3, and C20:0 fatty acids in milk fat and a lesser (P = 0.03) proportion of C20:3n-6 fatty acid when compared with cows fed the CON diet. Treatment did not affect (P ≥ 0.24) milk yield, milk protein, protein yield, milk fat, or milk fat yield. No interactions (P ≥ 0.52) were found between treatment and season of the year or parity, or between treatment and days open, pregnancies per AI at first or second service, or pregnancy loss.

  {"id":"Borreani1999","abstract":"Conditioning may greatly increase the drying rate of cut forage during the   initial stages of drying. Such results may be particularly useful for   silage systems (as opposed to haymaking). This study was conducted to   determine the drying rate and losses in six field wilting trials on pure   stands of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and Italian rye-grass (Lolium   multiflorum Lam.) when treated with different types of mower-conditioners   (rubber rolls; plastic or steel flails). Drying was measured by calculating   the water loss rate from two subsequent hourly weights of swath portions   placed on trays. Dry matter (DM) losses were estimated on 1.2-m lengths of   swaths immediately after cutting. The steel flail conditioner provided   faster drying than the other conditioning types for both crops. The effect   of the rubber roll conditioner was limited due to the swath structure,   especially with forage surface densities higher than 0.7 kg DM   m<sup>-2</sup>. Tedding positively interacted with the   conditioning treatment to increase the drying rate, especially when forage   was conditioned with the rubber roll machine. Shatter losses from alfalfa   were higher for the flail conditioner, ranging from 3.6 to 10.2%, and with   greater loss of crude protein. The DM losses were always lower than 2.5%   for Italian ryegrass. The most severe conditioning (steel flails) followed   by tedding is appropriate for grass, as it significantly reduces the   wilting time without affecting DM loss. However, a less severe conditioning   (rubber rolls) without tedding is more appropriate for wilting alfalfa, to   avoid excessive leaf and protein loss.","author":[{"family":"Borreani","given":"Giorgio"},{"family":"Tabacco","given":"Ernesto"},{"family":"Ciotti","given":"Angelo"}],"citation-key":"Borreani1999","container-title":"Agronomy Journal","DOI":"10.2134/agronj1999.00021962009100030016x","ISSN":"00021962","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"page":"457-463","title":"Effects of mechanical conditioning on wilting of alfalfa and Italian ryegrass for ensiling","type":"article-journal","volume":"91"},

This study examined the effect of the addition of Clinoptilolite to the diet of lactating dairy cows on milk production and milk com-position. Thirty-two lactating Holstein cows (average lactation length: 142 d) were blocked according to milk production, parity, and days of lactation for assignment to one of two dietary treatments: control diet; control diet + Clinoptilolite, 200g/d. The control diet was based on corn and alfalfa silages, hay and concentrates, and did not contain aflatoxins above the safe level. The experimental period lasted 76 days. The Clinoptilolite supplementation did not affect milk yield and milk composition other than urea contents. The urea level in milk was negatively affected by Clinoptilolite addition (con-trol group 29.7 mg/100 ml vs Clinoptilolite group 31.3 mg/100ml). The dietary addition of Clinoptilolite did not change pH, ammonia content and VFA molar percentages in the rumen. No dietary effect on mineral contents of blood plasma (Na, K, Zn, and Ca) was observed. In case of clinoptilolite use in dairy cattle feeding, scarce negative effect on milk pro-duction and quality are expected. Le zeoliti sono allumino-silicati naturali, alle quali viene riconosciuta un'importante azione adsorbente, in particolare nei confronti dello ione ammonio e delle micotossine. In natura ne esistono più di 50 tipi mentre oltre 200 sono quelle di sin-tesi. La clinoptilolite è una zeolite naturale tra le più impiegate nell'alimentazione dei bovini sia da latte che da carne, grazie alla sua ottima capacità di scambio cationico. Trentadue bovine frisone con una durata media di lattazione di 142 giorni, sono state divise in due gruppi bilanciati per produzione di latte, ordine di parto e giorni di lattazione. Nel caso delle bovine del gruppo trattato sono stati aggiunti 200 g/capo/giorno di Clinoptilolite, alla dieta base. Tale dieta era costituita da insilato di mais (19%), fieno polifita di prato stabile (17%), insilato di medica (10%), mangime concentrato (52%) e farina di pesce (1,5%). Durante la prova, nella dieta il contenuto di aflatossine totali rilevato era inferiore alla soglia dei 10 ppb. Il periodo di osservazione ha avuto una durata di tre mesi, nei quali si sono raccolti complessivamente 544 campioni di latte, 32 campioni di succo ruminale e 32 campioni di sangue.

The basal diet was formulated to meet National Research Council (NRC, 2001) requirements for energy and all nutrients except rumen-degradable protein (RDP) and metabolizable protein. Experimental periods lasted 14 d with the first 9 d for adaptation. The basal diet, without urea addition, contained 9.2% RDP in DM and had a predicted RDP balance of -167 g/d (NRC, 2001). There were no effects of dietary treatment on ruminal true digestibility of organic matter or ruminal apparent digestibility of neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber. Total ruminal volatile fatty acid concentrations increased linearly with increasing urea level. Feeding increasing amounts of urea quadratically increased rumen ammonia N concentrations (9.0, 11.9, 12.8, and 17.4 mg/dL at 0, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9% urea supplementation, respectively), passage of microbial N, and microbial N in duodenal digesta as a percentage of nonammonia N. The results of this study indicate that there were some positive effects of adding urea to the described lactating dairy cow diet, and that microbial protein synthesis was maximized at an average ruminal ammonia N concentration of 12.8 mg/dL when urea was added at 0.6% in diet DM.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Boucher","given":"S E"},{"family":"Ordway","given":"R S"},{"family":"Whitehouse","given":"N L"},{"family":"Lundy","given":"F P"},{"family":"Kononoff","given":"P J"},{"family":"Schwab","given":"C G"}],"citation-key":"Boucher2007","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2007-0012","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",12]]},"page":"5619-33","PMID":"18024754","title":"Effect of incremental urea supplementation of a conventional corn silage-based diet on ruminal ammonia concentration and synthesis of microbial protein.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18024754","volume":"90"},

  {"id":"boumaLongitudinalStudyUdder2016","abstract":"Udder cleft dermatitis (UCD) is a skin lesion in dairy cows, most often located between anterior parts of the udder and abdomen, but also found between the front quarters. A few recent studies have investigated the prevalence of UCD, but relatively little is known about its pathogenesis, clinical course, and duration. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and recovery of UCD on high-prevalence herds. Five Dutch dairy herds with a UCD prevalence of at least 6% were visited weekly for 19 wk, followed by visits every other week for 26 wk. During each visit, all dry and lactating cows were inspected for the presence of UCD signs. If a UCD case was detected, the affected skin was photographed and the photo was subsequently examined by a research assistant. Cows were then classified according to the appearance of the skin into 3 categories: healthy (no photo: no signs), mild (photo: affected skin but no wound), or severe (photo: open wound). The overall mean within-herd prevalence of UCD was 38% and the overall mean incidence was 1.94 UCD episodes per 100 cow-weeks at risk. Incidence of UCD was significantly higher in cows in third or higher parity and significantly increased with DIM. Median observed duration of UCD was 16 wk. The UCD recovery was 3 times more likely for mild than for severe lesions. The probability of moving from one category to another between 2 consecutive visits was very low, indicating that rapid changes in appearance did not occur. The observed incidence of UCD was rather low, and the relatively high prevalence in the selected herds was most likely due to the long duration of lesions rather than a high incidence of new UCD cases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Bouma","given":"A."},{"family":"Nielen","given":"M."},{"family":"Soest","given":"E.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Sietsma","given":"S."},{"family":"Broek","given":"J.","non-dropping-particle":"van den"},{"family":"Dijkstra","given":"T."},{"family":"Werven","given":"T.","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"boumaLongitudinalStudyUdder2016","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2015-9774","ISSN":"15253198","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",6,1]]},"page":"4487-4495","PMID":"27016832","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","title":"Longitudinal study of udder cleft dermatitis in 5 Dutch dairy cattle herds","type":"article-journal","volume":"99"},
  {"id":"Bourg2012","abstract":"Two experiments were conducted to examine the impact of source, urea (U) or Optigen II (OP), and level of dietary NPN on performance (Exp.1) and N balance (Exp. 2) of growing cattle. Sixty Angus crossbred steers (initial BW = 353 ± 13.9 kg) were used to evaluate performance, and fed 1 of 3 steam-flaked corn based diets: U (U1.2, 1.2% NPN), OP (OP1.3, 1.3% NPN), or OP without cottonseed meal (OP3.1, 3.1% NPN). U1.2 and OP1.3 contained cottonseed meal and NPN as CP sources, whereas OP3.1 contained only NPN. For Exp. 1, steers were blocked by postweaning BW and assigned to treatment (TRT) and pen within block. Body weight was collected every 14 d during the 105-d trial. Six steers from each TRT were selected based on residual feed intake (RFI) and harvested. Carcass and organ measurements were obtained. Cumulative animal performance was evaluated in 3 periods (0 to 35, 0 to 70, and 0 to 105 d) using a mixed coefficient model with initial BW as a covariate. For Exp. 2, 5 ruminally cannulated Holstein steers in a 5 × 5 Latin square design were used to evaluate N balance. Steers were fed a steam-flaked corn based diet with either no NPN, 0.75% U or N equivalent OP, or 1.5% U or N equivalent OP. Intake was measured, and feed, orts, urine, and fecal samples were obtained and composited for each steer by period. Data were analyzed using a mixed coefficient model. Orthogonal contrasts were used to evaluate differences between OP and U, and high and low level of NPN. For Exp. 1, there were no differences (P > 0.10) in initial BW, final BW, ADG, or DMI among TRT for any of the periods. However, for period 1 steers on OP3.1 had reduced F:G than U1.2 (5.71kg/kg vs. 7.39 kg/kg; P = 0.03), and steers fed OP1.3 tended to have less F:G than those fed U1.2 (6.07 kg/kg vs. 7.39kg/kg; P = 0.07). In period 2, OP3.1 had reduced F:G than U1.2 (5.58 kg/kg vs. 6.56kg/kg; P = 0.03), but did not differ from OP1.3 (5.97). For Exp. 2, steers fed OP tended (P = 0.09) to have less apparent N absorption than those fed U. Apparent N absorption differed (P < 0.05) for level of NPN. There were no differences (P > 0.10) in intake or digestibility among source or level of NPN. No major differences (P > 0.10) on performance and carcass composition were observed between U and OP diets. Steers had better initial F:G (Period 1 and 2) when OP was used as the only source of feed N (OP3.1), suggesting that OP may replace true protein feeds in finishing cattle diets, minimizing feed use with no impact on carcass quality. © 2012 American Society of Animal Science.

  {"id":"Bouwstra2010","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate, retrospectively, which physiological states influenced the effect of vitamin E supplements during the dry period on the level of oxidative stress at 2 wk antepartum. Furthermore the effect of oxidative stress at 2 wk antepartum on the risk of clinical mastitis in early lactation was investigated. Cows experience oxidative stress around calving. Vitamin E is able to decrease oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals. Normally, vitamin E radicals formed when vitamin E reacts with free radicals are regenerated by a network of other antioxidants, termed the \"vitamin E regeneration system\" (VERS). In case of vitamin E supplementation, VERS should be sufficient to regenerate formed vitamin E radicals; if not, oxidative stress might increase instead of decrease. Additionally, the level of oxidative stress and vitamin E might be important physiological states to evaluate before supplementation. In a clinical trial, 296 cows on 5 farms were randomly divided into 2 groups, supplemented with a mineral mix between dry off and calving that supplied 3,000 or 135 IU/d, respectively. Blood samples collected at dry off and 2 wk antepartum were analyzed for vitamin E, reactive oxygen metabolites, ferric-reducing ability of plasma, glutathione peroxidase, and malondialdehyde. Cows were allocated retrospectively into 8 subgroups based on the level of oxidative stress, vitamin E, and VERS status at dry off. To evaluate whether differences in physiological states at dry off influenced the effect of vitamin E supplementation on the level of oxidative stress, group effects (supplemented vs. control) were studied with Student's t-test for all 8 subgroup at 2 wk antepartum. Differences in physiological states at dry off influenced the effect of vitamin E supplements. In 2 insufficient VERS subgroups, the supplemented group had higher levels of free radicals at 2 wk antepartum compared with the control group. Relative risk calculation was used to study the effect of oxidative stress at 2 wk antepartum on the incidence of mastitis in the first 100 d of lactation. Higher levels of oxidative stress at 2 wk antepartum were related to higher risk of clinical mastitis. In conclusion, not every dry cow responded well to high vitamin E supplementation. This subgroup analysis provides a possible explanation for the unexpected adverse effects observed in the clinical trial.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Bouwstra","given":"R J"},{"family":"Nielen","given":"M"},{"family":"Newbold","given":"J R"},{"family":"Jansen","given":"E H J M"},{"family":"Jelinek","given":"H F"},{"family":"Werven","given":"T","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"Bouwstra2010","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2010-3161","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",12]]},"page":"5696-706","PMID":"21094741","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Vitamin E supplementation during the dry period in dairy cattle.

  {"id":"Bouwstra2010a","abstract":"A randomized, controlled field trial with dairy cows demonstrated an adverse effect of vitamin E supplementation during the dry period on mastitis incidence in early lactation. This study was conducted on farms with historically high rates of mastitis to investigate the benefit of vitamin E supplementation on udder health; however, the outcome showed an adverse effect. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether daily supplementation of 3,000 IU of vitamin E to dairy cows during the dry period could improve udder health in commercial herds with a high incidence of mastitis. On 5 dairy farms, dry cows were randomly divided into 2 experimental groups: a high and a low group. Both groups received a dry cow mineral mix providing 3,000 or 135 IU of vitamin E/cow per day, respectively, between dry-off and calving for a mean period of 8 wk. Providing 3,000 IU of vitamin E exceeds NRC standards, but this amount has been used in previous studies. The experiment, as well as the majority of the statistical analysis, were carried out blinded. Blood was sampled 3 times before calving and on calving day. Serum was analyzed for vitamin E and cholesterol. Vitamin E and the vitamin E:cholesterol ratio were analyzed as dependent variables in mixed models and Student's t-tests to study trends in time and differences between groups. Relative risk calculation and survival analysis were used to study the effect of supplementation on mastitis incidence in the first 3 mo of lactation. The results showed that vitamin E supplements increased both absolute vitamin E and the ratio of vitamin E to cholesterol in blood. In the high group, significantly more subclinical and clinical cases occurred, showing the same trend on all farms. In this study, an initial vitamin E level at dry off above 14.5 μmol/L was a risk factor for clinical mastitis, suggesting that the vitamin E status at the start of the dry period is important. It is recommended to work out exactly at what threshold vitamin E is harmful for udder health before new trials with high dosages of vitamin E are started. Additionally, further research is required to investigate the mechanism by which vitamin E affects udder health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Bouwstra","given":"R J"},{"family":"Nielen","given":"M"},{"family":"Stegeman","given":"J","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Dobbelaar","given":"P"},{"family":"Newbold","given":"J R"},{"family":"Jansen","given":"E H J M"},{"family":"Werven","given":"T","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"Bouwstra2010a","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2010-3159","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",12]]},"page":"5684-95","PMID":"21094740","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Vitamin E supplementation during the dry period in dairy cattle.

  {"id":"Bradford2012","abstract":"High-fiber byproducts are generated by several industries, and the supplies of some of these nonforage fiber sources (NFFS) are increasing. Although NFFS generally have limited utility in nonruminant diets, dairy cattle nutritionists can use these products to partially replace both forages and concentrates in lactation diets. Research has shown that production responses vary, but under certain conditions, NFFS-based diets can maintain or improve performance of dairy cattle. Traditional dietary formulation strategies are not ideal when formulating diets to contain large concentrations of NFFS. When feeding high levels of NFFS (≥15% inclusion rates, dry matter basis), less physically effective fiber is required; however, determining if this requirement has been met can be challenging, mainly because of the lack of a broadly applicable method for quantifying effective fiber in the field. Nutritionists must also be conscious of the nutrient variation that exists among many NFFS. Strategies to reduce risks associated with this variability include purchasing feed from a sole supplier who demonstrates product consistency and combining multiple NFFS at lower inclusion rates. A targeted approach whereby nonforage fiber primarily replaces some forage fiber for higher-producing cows but partially replaces some starch for lower-producing cows can optimize nutrient utilization without sacrificing animal health. In summary, the judicious use of NFFS represents an opportunity to improve the productivity and health of cattle in all stages of lactation while potentially controlling feed costs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Bradford","given":"B J"},{"family":"Mullins","given":"C R"}],"citation-key":"Bradford2012","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5393","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",9]]},"page":"4735-46","PMID":"22916877","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Invited review: strategies for promoting productivity and health of dairy cattle by feeding nonforage fiber sources.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22916877","volume":"95"},

  {"id":"Brask-Pedersen2013","abstract":"The effect of exogenous phytase on inositol phosphate degradation in the rumen of dairy cows was investigated in a 4×4 Latin square design. Four lactating Danish Holstein cows fitted with ruminal, duodenal, and ileal cannulas were offered a total mixed ration (TMR) with a high content of inositol phosphate and supplemented with 1 of 4 concentrations of phytase [none, low, medium, or high, corresponding to 23, 2,023, 3,982, and 6,015 phytase units/kg of dry matter (DM)]. Exogenous phytase lead to a higher rumen pool of phytase. Inositol phosphate content in digesta samples from rumen, duodenum, ileum, and feces was almost entirely composed of myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)), indicating that degradation of this compound is the rate-limiting step in inositol phosphate degradation in the digestive tract. Ruminal and total-tract degradations of InsP(6) were higher when exogenous phytase was added to the TMR. Degradation of InsP(6) occurred mainly before the duodenum. The ruminal degradability of InsP(6) was increased with increasing dietary concentrations of phytase: 86.4, 93.7, 94.5, and 96.3% for none, low, medium, or high, respectively. A comparison of the InsP(6) content in individual feedstuffs and in samples of the TMR revealed that the exogenous phytase started degrading the inositol phosphate when feeds and phytase were mixed, and thus the InsP(6) phosphorus (InsP(6)-P) content in the TMR was found to decrease with higher doses of phytase (1.69, 1.51, 1.39, and 1.25g/kg of DM for the none, low, medium, and high phytase doses, respectively). It was not possible to distinguish between the degradation of inositol phosphate occurring in the TMR and in the rumen. Exogenous phytase had no effect on total P intake or flow of total P to the duodenum and ileum, whereas exogenous phytase increased flow of microbial P to the duodenum and total fecal P excretion. None of the investigated rumen variables (pH, degradability of neutral detergent fiber, and rumen kinetics for neutral detergent fiber) were affected by treatment. Rumen and total-tract degradations of inositol phosphate were increased when exogenous phytase was added to the TMR, which offers the potential for reducing P excretion through reduced dietary P.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Brask-Pedersen","given":"D N"},{"family":"Glitsø","given":"L V"},{"family":"Skov","given":"L K"},{"family":"Lund","given":"P"},{"family":"Sehested","given":"J"}],"citation-key":"Brask-Pedersen2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2011-5278","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3]]},"page":"1691-700","PMID":"23312994","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of exogenous phytase on degradation of inositol phosphate in dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23312994","volume":"96"},

Replacing alfalfa with red clover improved feed and N efficiency and apparent digestibility of DM, organic matter, neu- 1728 tral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and hemicellu-lose in both trials. Net energy of lactation computed from animal performance data was 18% greater in red clover than alfalfa. Data on milk and blood urea and N efficiency suggested better N utilization on red clover.

  {"id":"Broderick2003","abstract":"Forty-five multiparous and 18 primiparous Holstein cows were fed three levels of crude protein (CP), each at three levels of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), to identify optimal dietary CP and energy. Cows were blocked by parity and days in milk into seven groups of nine and randomly assigned to an incomplete 9 x 9 Latin square trial with four, 4-wk periods. Diets were formulated from alfalfa and corn silages, high-moisture corn, soybean meal, minerals, and vitamins. Forage was 60% alfalfa and 40% corn silage on all diets; NDF contents of 36, 32, and 28% were obtained by feeding 75, 63, and 50% forage, respectively. Dietary CP contents of 15.1, 16.7, and 18.4% were obtained by replacing high-moisture corn with soybean meal. Production data were from the last 2 wk of each period. Spot fecal and urine samples were collected from 36 cows to estimate N excretion using fecal indigestible acid detergent fiber (ADF) and urinary creatinine as markers. There were no interactions (P > or = 0.08) between dietary CP and NDF for any trait; thus, effects of CP were not confounded by NDF or vice versa. Intake of DM and fat yield were lower on 15.1% CP than at higher CP. There were linear increases in milk urea and urinary N excretion and linear decreases in N efficiency with increasing CP. Increasing CP from 15.1 to 18.4% reduced milk N from 31 to 25% of dietary N, increased urinary N from 23 to 35% of dietary N, and reduced fecal N from 45 to 41% of dietary N. Decreasing NDF gave linear increases in BW gain, yield of milk, protein, true protein, lactose, and SNF, and milk/DM intake and milk N/N intake, and linear decreases in milk urea. However, fat yield was lower on 28% than 32% NDF. Reducing NDF from 36 to 28% increased purine derivative excretion by 19%, suggesting increased microbial protein. Increasing CP by adding soybean meal to diets fed cows averaging 34 kg/d of milk increased intake and fat yield but depressed N efficiency. Increasing dietary energy by reducing forage improved milk yield and efficiency and decreased excretion of environmentally labile urinary N.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Broderick","given":"G","dropping-particle":"a"}],"citation-key":"Broderick2003","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(03)73721-7","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",4]]},"page":"1370-81","PMID":"12741562","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effects of varying dietary protein and energy levels on the production of lactating dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12741562","volume":"86"},

  {"id":"Broderick2017","abstract":"Two lactation trials were conducted comparing the feeding value of silages made from birdsfoot trefoil (BFT, Lotus corniculatus L.) that had been selected for low (BFTL), medium (BFTM), and high (BFTH) lev-els of condensed tannins (CT) to an alfalfa silage (AS) when fed as the principal forage in total mixed rations. Diets also included corn silage, high-moisture shelled corn, soybean meal, soy hulls, and supplemental fat. In trial 1, 32 lactating Holstein cows were blocked by days in milk, assigned to treatment sequences in 8 balanced 4 × 4 Latin squares, and fed 50% dietary dry matter from AS or 1 of 3 BFT silages containing 0.6, 1.2, or 1.7% CT. Diets averaged 17.5 to 19.5% crude protein and 26% neutral detergent fiber on a dry matter basis. Data were collected over the last 2 wk of each 4-wk pe-riod. Intakes were 1.3 to 2.8 kg of dry matter/d greater on BFT than on AS and cows gained 0.5 kg of body weight/d on BFT diets while losing 0.14 kg of body weight/d on the AS diet; this resulted in greater milk per dry matter intake (DMI) on AS. Linear effects indi-cated true protein yield and milk urea nitrogen declined with increasing CT concentration and quadratic effects indicated DMI, energy-corrected milk, and fat yield were increased at intermediate CT concentration. True protein yield and apparent N-efficiency were greater, and milk urea nitrogen lower, on all BFT diets than on AS. In trial 2, 50 lactating Holstein cows were fed a covariate AS diet for 2 wk and then blocked by parity and days in milk and randomly assigned to 1 of 5 diets that were fed continuously for 12 wk. Diets contained (dry matter basis) 48% AS, 16% AS plus 32% of 1 of 3 BFT silages with 0.5, 0.8, or 1.5% CT, or 48% of an equal mixture of each BFT silage. Diets averaged 16.5% crude protein and 30% neutral detergent fiber. Intake and milk yield tended to be lower on AS than BFT, but body weight gains averaged 0.6 kg/d on all diets. Cows fed any of the BFT silages had reduced milk urea nitrogen and ruminal ammonia and reduced urinary N excretion. Feeding the BFT mixture reduced concentra-tions of milk true protein and milk urea nitrogen and depressed apparent nutrient digestibility. Among diets containing the individual BFT silages, linear reductions in DMI and yield of milk, fat, true protein, lactose, and SNF were observed with increasing CT concentration. By contrast, a previous trial with the same BFT popula-tions showed that substituting BFTH silage containing 1.6% CT for AS in rations containing 60% silage dry matter had no effect on intake, increased yield of milk, energy-corrected milk and milk components, elevated protein use-efficiency, but with a more modest reduc-tion in milk urea nitrogen and urinary N excretion. Si-lage analyses suggested that the inconsistent responses among trials were related to growth environment or ensiling effects that altered tannin-protein interactions in BFT silage. Differences in diet formulation among trials may have also influenced responses. Results from the current and previous trials indicate further work is needed to identify optimum tannin levels in forages.","author":[{"family":"Broderick","given":"G.A."},{"family":"Grabber","given":"J.H."},{"family":"Muck","given":"R.E."},{"family":"Hymes-Fecht","given":"U.C."}],"citation-key":"Broderick2017","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2016-12073","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"3548-3562","PMID":"28259401","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Replacing alfalfa silage with tannin-containing birdsfoot trefoil silage in total mixed rations for lactating dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030217301844","volume":"100"},

  {"id":"Broudiscou1999","abstract":"Using dual outflow continuous fermenters, we have quantified the effects of two nitrogenous supplements on the degradation of ammonia-treated wheat straw by rumen microorganisms, and on the resulting microbial proteosynthesis. The two factors were (1) the amount of inorganic nitrogen supplied as a mixture of urea and ammonium sulfate (from 0 to 47 g CP kg-1 DM), (2) the amount of casein (from 0 to 52 g CP kg-1 DM). A Doehlert experimental design was applied and the responses were modeled using second-order polynomials. NH3-N concentration in the vessels was between 31.8 and 179.8 mg l-1 4 h after the meal, and was strongly increased by both nitrogenous supplements in a linear way. The addition of casein also increased the molar proportions of higher VFA. NDF and ADF degradabilities and OM true degradability averaged 56.4%, 55.9% and 57.7%, respectively, and were not significantly influenced by any experimental factor. The partitioning of OM input into undegraded, fermented and microbial fractions was not significantly changed by experimental treatments. The outflows of non-ammonia N and microbial N were slightly increased by intermediate levels of N supplementation, leading to minor changes in the efficiency of microbial protein synthesis (mean: 21.9 g N kg-- OMF). As a conclusion, supplementing ammonia-treated wheat straw with inorganic nitrogen or casein up to a level of 50 g CP kg-1 DM did not induce significant changes in the utilisation of straw by rumen micro-organisms.","author":[{"family":"Broudiscou","given":"L.

  {"id":"Brown2013","abstract":"Effects of glucose infusion on feed intake, milk production, and metabolic responses of early postpartum cows fed diets varying in starch and protein concentration were evaluated by utilizing a randomized complete block design with a 2. ×. 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Twenty-four multiparous Holstein cows were blocked by body condition score and 305-d mature-equivalent milk yield and randomly assigned at calving to 1 of 4 treatments. Treatments were continuous intrajugular infusion of glucose (GI) or isotonic saline (SI), and diets containing high starch, low crude protein (HSLP) or high crude protein, low starch (HPLS) concentrations. Treatments were initiated at the first scheduled feeding following parturition and lasted 12. d. The GI reduced cumulative dry matter intake and tended to reduce daily dry matter intake and meal size for HPLS but not HSLP compared with SI. The GI increased cumulative milk yield by 39. kg/12. d compared with SI by increasing it for HSLP but not HPLS. The HPLS treatment tended to increase loss of body condition from 0.65 to 0.82 body condition score units/12. d compared with HSLP. Consistent with this, HPLS increased plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids, β-hydroxybutyrate, liver triglyceride, milk fat concentration and yield, 3.5% fat-corrected milk, and milk urea nitrogen compared with HSLP. Overall, the GI-HPLS treatment reduced feed intake by reducing meal size. The GI-HPLS may have reduced meal size by the independent or additive effects of (1) decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis and promoting oxidation of acetyl coenzyme A (CoA), (2) elevated plasma nonesterified fatty acids from HPLS increasing the pool of acetyl CoA available to be oxidized, and (3) the HPLS diet increasing urea synthesis, which also provides the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate fumarate to promote oxidation of acetyl CoA. © 2013 American Dairy Science Association.","author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"W.

Twenty-six multiparous Holstein dairy cows were retrospectively selected according to BCS at 4 wk prepartum and divided into high (HighBCS, BCS ≥ 3.50) and normal (NormBCS, BCS ≤ 3.25) BCS groups (n = 13 each). Blood plasma samples were obtained at −30, −10, 7, 15, and 30 d relative to calving. Liver tissue biopsies were performed at −15, 7, and 30 d relative to calving, and samples were used to assess protein abundance via Western blot assay. Cows in the HighBCS group lost ~1 unit of BCS between −4 and 4 wk around calving, while NormBCS cows lost ~0.5 unit in the same period. Prepartal dry matter intake (DMI, kg/d) did not differ between groups. Compared with NormBCS cows, HighBCS cows had higher postpartal DMI and milk yield (+5.34 kg/d). In addition, greater overall plasma concentrations of fatty acids and activity of the neutrophil-enriched enzyme myeloperoxidase were observed in HighBCS compared with NormBCS cows. Despite similar reactive oxygen metabolite concentrations in both groups at 30 d, HighBCS cows had lower overall concentrations of β-carotene and tocopherol, explaining the lower (BCS × Time) antioxidant capacity (ferric reducing ability of plasma). The HighBCS cows also had greater liver malondialdehyde concentrations and superoxide dismutase activity at 30 d. Overall, compared with NormBCS cows, HighBCS cows had lower hepatic protein abundance of the 1-carbon metabolism enzymes cystathionine-β-synthase, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase, and methionine adenosyltransferase 1 A (MAT1A), as well as the glutathione metabolism-related enzymes glutathione S-transferase α 4 and glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3). A lower protein abundance of glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1) at −15 and 7 d was also observed. Regardless of BCS, cows had increased abundance of GSTM1 and GPX3 between −15 and 7 d around calving. A marked decrease of gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase 1 from −10 to 7 d in HighBCS compared with NormBCS cows suggested a decrease in de novo carnitine synthesis that was partly explained by the lower abundance of MAT1A. Overall, data suggest biologic links between BCS before calving, milk yield, immune response, and hepatic reactions encompassing 1-carbon metabolism, carnitine, and antioxidant synthesis.","author":[{"family":"Bucktrout","given":"R.

  {"id":"bueno2020","abstract":"The interest of ensiling total mixed rations (TMR) for ruminants reemerged in the last decades. In many situations, ensiling TMR has been a sustainable alternative to efficiently handle wet byproducts in ruminant diets. An ensiled TMR typically has a markedly higher aerobic stability than its respective fresh TMR. Ensiling a TMR increases ruminal protein degradability due to proteolysis during storage. An increase of feed efficiency by ruminants fed ensiled rations have been reported, due to the improved starch digestibility in TMR silages containing cereal grains. This manuscript brings an overview of the main nutrient transformations during the ensiling of TMR and their feeding value for ruminants.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Bueno","given":"Antonio Vinicius Iank"},{"family":"Lazzari","given":"Gustavo"},{"family":"Jobim","given":"Clóves Cabreira"},{"family":"Daniel","given":"João Luiz Pratti"}],"citation-key":"bueno2020","container-title":"Agronomy","DOI":"10.3390/agronomy10060879","ISSN":"2073-4395","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"6","page":"879","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Ensiling Total Mixed Ration for Ruminants: A Review","title-short":"Ensiling Total Mixed Ration for Ruminants","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/10/6/879","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"Cabezas-Garcia2017","abstract":"This study evaluated the effects of gradual replacement of a mixture of late-cut grass silage (LS) and barley with early-cut grass silage (ES) on milk production, CH4 emissions, and N utilization in Swedish Red cows. Two grass silages were prepared from the same primary growth of timothy grass sward but harvested 2 wk apart [11.0 and 9.7 MJ of metabolizable energy/kg of dry matter (DM)]. Four diets, fed as a total mixed ration, were formulated to meet the metabolizable energy and protein requirements of 35 kg of energy-corrected milk (ECM) by gradually replacing a mixture of LS and barley with ES (0, 33, 67, and 100% of the forage component of the diet), whereas the proportion of barley decreased from 47.2 to 26.6% of diet DM. Expeller canola meal was used as a protein supplement. Sixteen Swedish Red cows were used in 4 replicated 4 × 4 Latin squares. Cows were offered diets ad libitum and milked twice daily. Each period of 28 d comprised 14 d of diet adaptation followed by 14 d of data collection. Intake and milk yield were recorded daily, and milk samples were collected on d 19 to 21 and d 26 to 28 of each period. Diet digestibility was determined by grab sampling using indigestible neutral detergent fiber as an internal marker. Gas emissions were measured using the GreenFeed system (C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, SD). Dry matter intake (DMI) linearly decreased from 22.6 to 19.3 kg/d as the proportion of ES increased in the diet. The ECM yield did not differ among treatments, but milk protein yield decreased with increasing proportion of ES in the diet. Because of reduced DMI with increasing ES, feed efficiency (ECM/DMI) improved with an increased proportion of ES in the diet. Nitrogen efficiency (milk N/N intake) did not change despite a linear increase in milk urea N concentration from 9.7 (LS alone) to 11.9 mg/dL (ES alone) with graded replacement of LS and barley by ES in the diet. Lower DMI responses in ES diets were partly compensated for by increased organic matter digestibility (656 g/kg of DM for LS alone; 715 g/kg of DM for ES alone) related to improved forage digestibility at early harvesting. Total CH4 emissions and CH4 intensity (CH4/ECM) were not influenced by diet, but CH4 yield (CH4/DMI) increased linearly from 19.5 to 23.0 g/kg of DMI with greater inclusion of ES in the diet. In conclusion, replacing LS and barley with ES improved the conversion of feed to milk without increasing CH4 emissions or compromising N efficiency.","author":[{"family":"Cabezas-Garcia","given":"E.H."},{"family":"Krizsan","given":"S.J."},{"family":"Shingfield","given":"K.J."},{"family":"Huhtanen","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"Cabezas-Garcia2017","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2016-12444","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"5228-5240","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Effects of replacement of late-harvested grass silage and barley with early-harvested silage on milk production and methane emissions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002203021730509X","volume":"100"},

  {"id":"cameron2018","abstract":"There have been reductions in grazing cattle and corresponding increases in mixed diets across many regions. Mixed diets consist of silage, grains, legumes and other herbaceous plants (termed total mixed ration, TMR). TMR has been associated with increased milk yields but has also been linked to increased enteric methane production. We measured milk yields and methane production from high-yielding Holstein-Friesian cattle after substituting 29%-36% of a TMR diet with grass. Two feeding treatments were compared with a diet of TMR: grass grazed at pasture and grass cut in the field and delivered to housed cattle (termed cut-and-carry). Each feeding treatment was fed to 15 cattle, and the experiment was conducted in Southwest Scotland. Using a laser methane detector, we measured a twofold and fourfold decline in enteric methane production for the cut-and-carry and grazing groups, respectively, when the animals consumed grass. TMR was consumed by both grass-fed groups overnight, so daily values were adjusted to include elevated methane production during this period. This revealed that methane production for the cut-and-carry and grazing groups was 17% and 39% lower than for the TMR-fed group respectively. Milk yields were maintained for all three groups, and the efficiency of milk production per unit of methane was substantially greater for the two grass-fed groups. A shift away from exclusively feeding TMR by adding fresh grass to the diets of cattle could contribute to meeting emissions targets and could also represent an economically sustainable climate change mitigation strategy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Cameron","given":"L"},{"family":"Chagunda","given":"| M G G"},{"family":"Roberts","given":"| D J"},{"family":"Lee","given":"| M A"},{"family":"Lee","given":"M A"}],"citation-key":"cameron2018","DOI":"10.1111/gfs.12353","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"title":"A comparison of milk yields and methane production from three contrasting high-yielding dairy cattle feeding regimes: Cut-and-carry, partial grazing and total mixed ration","type":"article-journal"},

Sixty-four primigravid heifers (56 Holstein and 8 Jersey) and 80 multiparous cows (64 Holstein and 16 Jersey) were used. A combination of vitamin E or Zn and Fe was fed in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement during the last 42 d prepartum. Amounts of supplements per animal were 1000 IU of vitamin E (d, l alpha-tocopheryl acetate), 0.8 g of Zn (Zn-Met and ZnSO4), and 12 g of Fe (FeSO4.7H2O) for Holsteins and 9 g for Jerseys. Neither vitamin E nor Zn directly affected the incidence of retained fetal membranes, but plasma alpha-tocopherol was lower when fetal membranes were retained > 12 h or when vitamin E was not supplemented. Iron had no direct negative effects on reproductive performance, but cows receiving additional Fe had lower unsaturated iron-binding capacity, which, in turn, was also lower in cows that retained fetal membranes. Days to first observed estrus were reduced by supplementation with either vitamin E or Zn. Vitamin E reduced days to first artificial insemination (AI) and tended to reduce days open. Supplemental Zn tended to reduce days to first AI but did not affect days open. Milk production during the first 12 wk and AI per conception were not affected by supplementation with either vitamin E or Zn.

The main factors contributing to DD are an infection with Treponema spp. and poor hygiene. Topical treatment has primarily consisted of antibiotics; however, the demand for effective nonantibiotic alternatives is increasing. The objective was to evaluate the performance of 3 nonantibiotic topical treatments (salicylic acid and a compound of inorganic acids in a 20% solution and in a dry form) on DD in a commercial dairy herd. Within the 30-d test period, 42 DD lesions on 33 Holstein cows were assigned to receive 1 of the 3 treatments. Lesions were biopsied before and after treatment and were clinically evaluated 5 times. Improved lesions were clinically defined as either healed (regeneration of the skin) or healing (dry lesions covered by a scab). Unhealed lesions were defined as either active [with a raw, moist, strawberry-like (granulating) surface] or mature (with a raised papillomatous appearance). The effectiveness of treatment was evaluated histopathologically using the following scores: 0 (no spirochetes present), 1 (small number of spirochetes present in the epidermis), 2 (moderate number of spirochetes present and reaching an intermediary level in the epidermis), and 3 (large number of spirochetes present and reaching the deepest part of the epidermis or the superficial dermis). The improvement rate was 10/14 (71%) for salicylic acid, 11/15 (73%) for the inorganic acid solution, and 8/13 (62%) for the inorganic acid powder. The analysis showed no difference among treatments. The association between clinical score and histopathological score was determined by an odds ratio.

  {"id":"Caprita2010","abstract":"Abstract—Protein quality of soybean meal (SBM) is linked to both the reduction of anti-nutritional factors (ANFs), and the optimization of protein digestibility. Inadequate heating fails to completely destroy the ANFs. Excessive heating reduces the availability of lysine via the Maillard reaction and possibly, to a lesser extent, other amino acids, and decreases the protein nutritive quality. The objective of the study was the analysis of some chemical indices for determining SBM quality, and their correlation with biophysical indices. The experimental data revealed that urease index (UI) is useful to determine if the soybean meal has been heated enough to reduce ANFs, but it is not useful to determine excessive heat treatment. KOH solubility is a good index for determining over processing, but it is not a sensitive index for monitoring under processing of soybean meal. Combing protein dispersibility index (PDI) and UI could be useful to monitor soybean quality. The investigated biophysical indices are positively correlated with PDI: r = 0.9477 (p<0.01) for refractive index, and r=0.9406 (p<0.01) for dynamic viscosity. The biophysical methods have the advantage to be very rapid and nonpolluting since they don’t use chemical reagents.","author":[{"family":"Caprita","given":"Rodica"},{"family":"Caprita","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Ilia","given":"Gheorghe"},{"family":"Cretescu","given":"Iuliana"},{"family":"Simulescu","given":"Vasile Octavian"}],"citation-key":"Caprita2010","container-title":"Proceedings of the World Congress on Engineering and Computer Science 2010 Vol II","event-place":"San Francisco","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"publisher-place":"San Francisco","title":"Laboratory Procedures for Assessing Quality of Soybean Meal","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"Carbonneau2012","abstract":"During the transition from pregnancy to lactation, the sudden increase in nutrient demand for milk production causes metabolic perturbations and is associated with immunosuppression and a high incidence of metabolic and infectious diseases in high-yielding cows. In this study, we examined whether limiting milk harvest postpartum while maintaining milking stimulus could improve the metabolic status of cows without reducing overall milk production. Forty-seven Holstein cows were milked completely twice a day from calving (control); milked incompletely (about one-third of expected milk production was collected) twice a day until d 5 after calving (incomplete); or left to nurse their calf until d 5 and milked once a day from d 3 to d 5 (nursing). All cows were milked twice a day from d 6 to the end of the experiment (d 61). During the treatment period (d 1 to 5), milk production averaged 27.3 and 9.7 kg/d for the control and incomplete treatments, respectively. We observed no residual effect of treatment on milk production, which averaged 47.8, 45.7, and 46.4 kg/d for the control, incomplete, and nursing treatments, respectively, between wk 2 and 9. The dry matter intake of the cows was similar during and after treatment. From wk 2 to 9, milk protein and lactose percentage were not affected by treatments, but milk fat tended to be higher in control cows than in cows milked partially (incomplete + nursing). Blood concentrations of glucose and phosphorus were lower and concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate were higher in control cows than in partially milked cows during the treatment period. The positive effects on glucose and β-hydroxybutyrate remained significant up to d 28. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation and secretion of IL-4 were depressed during the postpartum period, and proliferation tended to be greater for cells incubated in serum from cows in the incomplete treatment on d 5 but lower on d 61. We observed no effect of treatments on polymorphonuclear neutrophilic leukocyte chemotaxis or phagocytosis. Proliferation and IL-4 secretion of PBMC were negatively correlated with concentration of serum nonesterified fatty acids. Reducing milk harvest postpartum while maintaining milking stimuli reduced metabolic stress without compromising productivity of high-yielding dairy cows.","author":[{"family":"Carbonneau","given":"E."},{"family":"Passillé","given":"A.M.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Rushen","given":"J."},{"family":"Talbot","given":"B.G."},{"family":"Lacasse","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"Carbonneau2012","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5643","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"6503-6512","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"The effect of incomplete milking or nursing on milk production, blood metabolites, and immune functions of dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-5643","volume":"95"},
  {"id":"Carder2017","abstract":"The first few weeks after parturition is marked by low, but increasing feed intake and sharply increasing milk production by dairy cows. Because of low intake, the nutrient density of the diet may need to be higher during this period to support increasing milk yields. We hypothesized that feeding higher levels of metabolizable protein (MP) or a protein supplement with rumen-protected lysine and methionine during the immediate postpartum period would increase yields of milk and milk components. Fifty-six Holstein cows (21 primiparous and 35 multiparous) starting at 3 d in milk were used in a randomized block design. In phase 1 (3 through 23 d in milk), cows were fed 1 of 3 diets that differed in supply of MP and AA profile. At 23 d in milk, all cows were moved to a common freestall pen and fed the control diet used in phase 1 for an additional 63 d (phase 2). Diets were formulated using the National Research Council model and were control [16.5% crude protein (CP), 10.9% rumen-degradable protein (RDP), and 5.6% rumen-undegradable protein (RUP)], high MP (HMP; 18.5% CP, 11.6% RDP, 6.9% RUP), and AA (MPAA; 17.5% CP, 10.5% RDP, 7.0% RUP 29.7). The MPAA diet included a proprietary spray-dried blood meal product (Perdue Agribusiness, Salisbury, MD) and contained a model-estimated 7.2 and 2.6% of digestible lysine and methionine (% of MP). The HMP and control diets contained 6.3 and 6.7% digestible lysine and both had 1.8% digestible methionine. In phase 1, diet did not affect milk yield (33.6, 34.7, and 33.2 kg for control, HMP, and MPAA, respectively), dry matter intake (17.8, 18.0, and 18.5 kg/d for control, HMP, and MPAA), or milk protein yield (1.07 kg/d). Feeding additional protein (HMP or MPAA) increased both the concentration and yield of milk fat, and milk protein concentration was greater (3.30 vs. 3.17%) for MPAA compared with the HMP diet. Energy-corrected milk was greater (38.4 and 38.6 vs. 35.3 kg/d, respectively) for MPAA and HP than for the control. Cows fed MPAA had the greatest plasma concentrations of Met and the lowest concentrations of isoleucine, but lysine was not affected by treatment. Feeding additional MP (HMP or MPAA) reduced the concentrations of 3-methylhistidine in plasma, indicating reduced muscle breakdown. Diet effects on milk composition continued after cows were changed to a common diet in that cows fed MPAA the first 3 wk of lactation had greater concentration of milk protein for the entire experiment than cows fed HMP, and cows fed additional MP (HMP and MPAA) during phase 1 had greater concentrations of milk fat for the entire experiment. Increasing dietary protein and AA supply in early lactation had short-term effects on yield of energy-corrected milk and long-term effects on milk composition.","author":[{"family":"Carder","given":"E.

  {"id":"Cardoso2013","abstract":"Negative energy balance during early postpartum is associated with reduced reproductive performance in dairy cows. A pooled statistical analysis of 7 studies completed in our group from 1993 to 2010 was conducted to investigate the association between prepartum energy feeding regimen and reproductive performance. The interval from calving to pregnancy (days to pregnancy, DTP) was the dependent variable to assess reproductive performance. Individual data for 408 cows (354 multiparous and 54 primiparous) were included in the analysis. The net energy for lactation (NEL) intake was determined from each cow's average dry matter intake and calculated dietary NEL density. Treatments applied prepartum were classified as either controlled-energy (CE; limited NEL intake to ≤100% of requirement) or high-energy (HE; cows were allowed to consume >100%) diets fed during the far-off (FO) or close-up (CU) dry periods. Cow was the experimental unit. The Cox proportional hazard model revealed that days to pregnancy was shorter for CE (median=157d) than HE (median=167d) diets during the CU period [hazard ratio (HR)=0.70]. Cows fed HE diets during the last 4wk prepartum lost more body condition score in the first 6wk postpartum than those fed CE diets (-0.43 and -0.30, respectively). Cows fed CE diets during the FO period had lower nonesterified fatty acids concentrations in wk 1, 2, and 3 of lactation than cows fed HE diets. Higher nonesterified fatty acids concentration in wk 1 postpartum was associated with a greater probability of disease (n=251; odds ratio=1.18). Cows on the CE regimen during the FO period had greater plasma glucose concentrations during wk 1 and 3 after calving than cows fed the HE regimen. Higher plasma glucose (HG) concentration compared with lower glucose (LG) in wk 3 (HG: n=154; LG: n=206) and wk 4 (HG: n=71; LG: n=254) after calving was associated with shorter days to pregnancy (wk 3: median=151 and 171d for HG and LG, respectively, and HR=1.3; wk 4: median=148 and 167d, respectively, and HR=1.4). In the first 2wk after calving, cows that received HE diets in the FO period had higher concentrations of total lipids and triglyceride and greater ratio of triglyceride to glycogen in liver than cows fed CE diets. In conclusion, cows fed CE diets during the CU period had a shorter interval between parturition and conception, which may be explained by increased NEL intake during the first 4wk postpartum and lower incidence of peripartal diseases. Lower body condition score loss during the first 6wk postpartum and slightly higher glucose concentration at wk 3 likely contributed to improved reproductive performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",9,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Cardoso","given":"F C"},{"family":"Leblanc","given":"S J"},{"family":"Murphy","given":"M R"},{"family":"Drackley","given":"J K"}],"citation-key":"Cardoso2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2013-6759","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",9]]},"page":"5859-71","PMID":"23810594","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Prepartum nutritional strategy affects reproductive performance in dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23810594","volume":"96"},

  {"id":"Carne2011","abstract":"We constructed a regression model to estimate the retention of electronic boluses in goats. With this aim, 2,482 boluses were administered to goats from dairy (Murciano-Granadina, n=1,326; French Alpine, n=381) and meat (Blanca de Rasquera, n=532) breeds. A total of 19 bolus types made of materials (ceramic, plastic tubes filled with concrete or silicone, and ballasts) differing in their specific gravity (SG) were used, thereby obtaining a wide variation in bolus features: diameter (9 to 22 mm), length (37 to 84 mm), weight (5 to 111 g), volume (2.6 to 26 mL), and SG (1.0 to 5.5). Each bolus contained a half-duplex glass encapsulated transponder (32 × 3.8mm) and was administered using adapted balling guns. Murciano-Granadina and Blanca de Rasquera goats also wore 2 visual plastic ear tags: V1 (double flag, 5.1g) and V2 (flag-button, 4.2g). No data on ear tags in French Alpine goats was available. Bolus and ear tag retention [(retained/monitored) × 100] was recorded for at least 1 yr. Dynamic reading efficiency [(dynamic reading/static reading) × 100] was also evaluated from 1,496 bolus readings. No administration incidences or apparent negative behavior or performance effects were observed for any bolus type. Static reading efficiency of retained boluses was 100%, except for the prototypes with metal ballasts, which yielded a 93.3% reading efficiency. Retention of metal-ballasted boluses was confirmed using x-ray equipment. Excluding ballasted boluses, a 99.5% dynamic reading efficiency was obtained. Ear tag losses were 6.5% for V1 and 3.7% for V2, ranging from 3.2 to 7.8% depending on ear tag type and goat breed. Bolus retention varied (0 to 100%) according to their physical features. Obtained data allowed the fitting of a logistic model of bolus retention rate according to bolus volume and weight (R(2) = 0.98); the SG was implicitly considered. Estimated weight and SG to produce medium- (15 mL) and standard-sized (22 mL) boluses for 99.95% retention rate in goats were 73.0 and 94.1g, and 4.87 and 4.28, respectively. Mini-boluses are not recommended, as none of the available radio translucent materials reach the required SG. In conclusion, increase of SG was fundamental to optimize bolus retention. Medium-sized boluses (10 to 15 mL; SG 5.8 to 4.9) for early administration and efficient retention in adult goats could be produced, thereby addressing the problem of using proper boluses for goat identification.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Carné","given":"S"},{"family":"Caja","given":"G"},{"family":"Ghirardi","given":"J J"},{"family":"Salama","given":"a a K"}],"citation-key":"Carne2011","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2010-3210","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",2]]},"page":"716-26","PMID":"21257040","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Modeling the retention of rumen boluses for the electronic identification of goats.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21257040","volume":"94"},

In the first, ryegrass‐clover was wilted rapidly in the laboratory (6 h) and in the field under good (48 h) and poor (48 h and 144 h) weather conditions. Protein breakdown and ammonia formation were negligible in herbage wilted rapidly and it was only when the crop was exposed to a prolonged wilt in humid conditions that appreciable proteolysis occurred. In the second experiment ryegrass‐clover was ensiled in laboratory silos after treatment with varying levels of formic and sulphuric acids. An additional treatment included herbage inoculated with a mixture of lactic acid bacteria and glucose. The silos were opened after 4 and 50 d and samples were analysed for protein‐N, ammonia‐N, water‐soluble carbohydrates and organic acids. There was a high negative correlation between level of addition of either acid and the degree of proteolysis and deamination. Even at the highest levels of formic acid (7·7 g per kg) and sulphuric acid (4·0 g per kg) additions, however, about 45% of the original herbage protein was degraded after 50 d in the silo. The inoculum treatment was also effective in reducing proteolysis, the effect after 50 d being comparable with formic acid applied at a rate of 4·1 g per kg. Copyright © 1979, Wiley Blackwell.

  {"id":"Carra2013","abstract":"The present study was investigated whether increasing amounts of glucose supply have a stimulatory effect on the mRNA abundance and activity of key lipogenic enzymes in adipose tissue of midlactation dairy cows. Twelve Holstein-Friesian dairy cows in midlactation were cannulated in the jugular vein and infused with either a 40% glucose solution (n=6) or saline (n=6). For glucose infusion cows, the infusion dose increased by 1.25%/d relative to the initial net energy for lactation (NEL) requirement until a maximum dose equating to a surplus of 30% NEL was reached on d 24. This maximum dose was maintained until d 28 and stopped thereafter (between d 29-32). Cows in the saline infusion group received an equivalent volume of 0.9% saline solution. Samples of subcutaneous adipose tissue were taken on d 0, 8, 16, 24, and 32 when surplus glucose reached 0, 10, 20, and 30% of the NEL requirement, respectively. The mRNA abundance of fatty acid synthase, cytoplasmic acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase, cytoplasmic glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-1, and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase showed linear treatment × dose interactions with increasing mRNA abundance with increasing glucose dose. The increased mRNA abundance was paralleled by a linear treatment × dose interaction for fatty acid synthase and acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase enzymatic activities. The mRNA abundance of ATP-citrate lyase showed a tendency for linear treatment × dose interaction with increasing mRNA abundance with increasing glucose dose. The mRNA abundance of all tested enzymes, as well as the activities of fatty acid synthase and acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase, correlated with plasma glucose and serum insulin levels. In a multiple regression model, the predictive value of insulin was dominant over that of glucose. In conclusion, gradual increases in glucose supply upregulate key lipogenic enzymes in adipose tissue of midlactating dairy cows with linear dose dependency. Insulin appears to be critically involved in this regulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Carra","given":"Mirja"},{"family":"Al-Trad","given":"Bahaa"},{"family":"Penner","given":"Gregory B"},{"family":"Wittek","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Gäbel","given":"Gotthold"},{"family":"Fürll","given":"Manfred"},{"family":"Aschenbach","given":"Jörg R"}],"citation-key":"Carra2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-6242","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",7]]},"page":"4299-309","PMID":"23660139","title":"Intravenous infusions of glucose stimulate key lipogenic enzymes in adipose tissue of dairy cows in a dose-dependent manner.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23660139","volume":"96"},

  {"id":"carteridDairyCowsValue2022","abstract":"As dairy cows are being housed for longer periods, with all-year-round housing growing in popularity, it is important to ensure housed environments are meeting the needs of cows. Dairy cows are motivated to access open lying areas, although previous motivation studies on this topic have confounded surface type and location (i.e. pasture outdoors vs cubicles indoors). This study measured cow motivation for lying down on an indoor open mattress (MAT; 9 m x 5 m) compared to indoor mattress-bedded cubicles, thus removing the confounding factor of surface type and location. This was repeated for an identically sized indoor deep-bedded straw yard (ST), to investigate whether surface type affected motivation for an open lying area. Thirty Holstein-Friesian dairy cows were housed in groups of 5 (n = 5 x 6) in an indoor robotic milking unit with access to six mattress-bedded cubicles. To assess motivation, cows were required to walk increasing distances via a one-way indoor raceway to access the open lying areas: Short (34.5 m), followed by Medium (80.5 m) and Long (126.5 m). Cows could choose to walk the raceway, leading to the MAT or ST, to lie down or they could lie down on the cubicles for 'free'. Overall, cows lay down for longer on the open lying areas at each distance compared to the cubicles, with cows lying down slightly longer on ST than MAT, although lying times on the open lying areas did decrease at the Long distance. However, cows were still lying for >60% of their lying time on the open lying areas at the Long distance. This study demonstrates that cows had a high motivation for an open lying area, the provision of which could better cater for the behavioural needs of housed dairy cows and improve housed dairy cow welfare.","author":[{"family":"Carterid","given":"Laura Shewbridge"},{"family":"Haskell","given":"Marie J"},{"family":"Ball","given":"David"},{"family":"Gibbons","given":"Jenny"},{"family":"Harris","given":"W Edwin"},{"family":"Rutter","given":"S Mark"}],"citation-key":"carteridDairyCowsValue2022","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0268238","ISBN":"1111111111","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"title":"Dairy cows value an open area for lying down","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268238"},

We propose a relatively unique approach that employs an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the most likely haplotype frequencies from a sample of population genotype data. Through an innovative ANN design for mapping genotype patterns to diplotypes, we have produced a prototype that demonstrates the feasibility of this approach, with provisional results that correlate well with estimates produced by the expectation maximization algorithm for haplotype frequency estimation. Given the computational demands of estimating haplotype frequencies for 20 or more single-nucleotide polymorphisms, the ANN approach is promising because its design fits well with parallel computing architectures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Cartier","given":"Kevin C"},{"family":"Baechle","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"Cartier2005","container-title":"BMC genetics","DOI":"10.1186/1471-2156-6-S1-S129","ISSN":"1471-2156","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",1]]},"page":"S129","PMID":"16451587","title":"An artificial neural network for estimating haplotype frequencies.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1866808&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","volume":"6 Suppl 1"},
  {"id":"carvalho2011","abstract":"Expansion of the biofuels industry has increased the availability of glycerol as an alternative feed for dairy cows. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of glycerol on feed intake, milk production, rumen volatile fatty acids, and metabolic parameters in transition dairy cows. Multiparous Holstein cows were fed diets containing either high-moisture corn (n = 11) or glycerol (n = 12) from -28 to +56 d relative to calving. Glycerol was included at 11.5 and 10.8% of the ration dry matter for the pre- and postpartum diets, respectively. Prepartum feed intake was not changed by glycerol feeding (14.9 vs. 14.6 kg/d, control vs. glycerol) nor did postpartum feed intake differ (19.8 vs. 20.7 kg/d, control vs. glycerol). Overall milk yield did not differ (35.8 vs. 37 kg/d, control vs. glycerol) and milk composition, milk urea nitrogen, somatic cells, and energy balance were not different with glycerol feeding. Blood glucose content was decreased in cows fed glycerol during the prepartum period (59.1 vs. 53.4 mg/dL), and [beta]-hydroxybutyrate concentration was increased (0.58 vs. 0.82 mmol/L, control vs. glycerol). Concentrations of blood nonesterified fatty acids did not differ between the treatment groups, and no response to glycerol for blood metabolites during the postpartum period was observed. Total rumen volatile fatty acid concentrations (mmol/L) did not differ between treatments, but proportions of rumen propionate and butyrate were greater for cows fed glycerol (22.7 vs. 28.6% of propionate, control vs. glycerol; and 11.5 vs. 15.3% of butyrate, control vs. glycerol) at the expense of acetate (61.4 vs. 51.5%, control vs. glycerol).

Dairies were selected to represent a range of herd milk yields and a range of water mineral contents. Samples of total mixed ration, drinking water, and bulk tank milk were taken on 2 different days, 3 to 7 d apart in each farm. Across-farm medians and percentile distributions were used to analyze results. The herd median milk yield interquartile ranged (10th to 90th percentile) from less than 25 to more than 39 kg/d and the concentration of total solids in water interquartile ranged from less than 200 to more than 1,490 mg/L. Including drinking water minerals in the diets increased dietary concentrations by <4% for all minerals except for Na and Cl, which increased by 9.3 and 6.5%, respectively. Concentrations of P and K in milk were essentially the same as the NRC value to estimate lactation requirements. However, NRC milk values of Ca, Cl, and Zn were 10 to 20% greater than dairy farm values; and Na, Cu, Fe, and Mn were no less than 36% below NRC values. Estimated excretion of minerals via manure varied substantially across farms. Farms in the 10th percentile did have 2 to 3 times less estimated mineral excretions than those in the 90th percentile (depending on the mineral). Although including water minerals increased excretion of most minerals, the actual median effect of Ca, Mg, S, Cu, Fe, and Mn was less than 5%, and about 8% for Na and Cl. Replacing assayed concentrations of minerals in milk with NRC constants resulted in reduced estimated excretion of Ca, Na, Cu, Fe, and Zn, but median differences were <5% except for Na which was 7.5%.

  {"id":"Celi2017","abstract":"Effective functionality of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and its health, are important factors in determining animal performance. Several, complex mechanisms are involved in the regulation of GIT functionality and health, therefore it is crucial to deepen our knowledge of these interactions so that strategies for the modulation of GIT functionality and health, in context of improved animal performance, can be developed. The concept of “gut health” has started to attract significant interest within the animal science community, however a clear definition of gastrointestinal health and functionality and how it can be measured is lacking. Therefore, this review will present a new definition of gastrointestinal functionality and will address how optimal gastrointestinal functionality can promote animal performances and welfare. The key components of gastrointestinal functionality reviewed in this article are: diet, effective structure and function of the gastrointestinal barrier, host interaction with the gastrointestinal microbiota, effective digestion and absorption of feed and effective immune status. While the relationships between these areas is extremely complex, a multidisciplinary approach is needed to develop nutritional strategies that would allow farm animals to become more resilient to the environmental and physiological challenges that they will have to endure during their productive career. As the demand of animal products from the rapidly growing world human population is ever-growing, the aim of this review is to present animal and veterinary scientists and nutritionists, a new definition of gastrointestinal functionality that can be used to establish a multidisciplinary approach to increase animal health, welfare and performance.","author":[{"family":"Celi","given":"P."},{"family":"Cowieson","given":"A.

  {"id":"Cha2011","abstract":"The objective of this study was to estimate the cost of 3 different types of clinical mastitis (CM) (caused by gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and other organisms) at the individual cow level and thereby identify the economically optimal management decision for each type of mastitis. We made modifications to an existing dynamic optimization and simulation model, studying the effects of various factors (incidence of CM, milk loss, pregnancy rate, and treatment cost) on the cost of different types of CM. The average costs per case (US$) of gram-positive, gram-negative, and other CM were $133.73, $211.03, and $95.31, respectively. This model provided a more informed decision-making process in CM management for optimal economic profitability and determined that 93.1% of gram-positive CM cases, 93.1% of gram-negative CM cases, and 94.6% of other CM cases should be treated. The main contributor to the total cost per case was treatment cost for gram-positive CM (51.5% of the total cost per case), milk loss for gram-negative CM (72.4%), and treatment cost for other CM (49.2%). The model affords versatility as it allows for parameters such as production costs, economic values, and disease frequencies to be altered. Therefore, cost estimates are the direct outcome of the farm-specific parameters entered into the model. Thus, this model can provide farmers economically optimal guidelines specific to their individual cows suffering from different types of CM. © 2011 American Dairy Science Association.","author":[{"family":"Cha","given":"E."},{"family":"Bar","given":"D."},{"family":"Hertl","given":"J.

  {"id":"chaincontam2011","abstract":"The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked by the European Commission to deliver a scientific opinion on pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA) in food and feed. PAs are toxins exclusively biosynthesised by plants. To date, approximately 600 different PAs are known. Results for 13,280 bulk honey and 1324 retail honey samples were provided to EFSA by one Member State and 351 feed samples were provided by a second Member State. The EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) performed estimates of both acute and chronic exposure to PAs through honey for three different age groups. Although there might be other sources of PA exposure, due to lack of data the CONTAM Panel was not able to quantify dietary exposure from food other than honey. A number of PAs were identified as being of particular importance for food and feed. Based on the present knowledge of metabolism, activation, DNA adduct-formation, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity, the CONTAM Panel concluded that 1,2–unsaturated PAs may act as genotoxic carcinogens in humans. Therefore, the CONTAM Panel decided to apply the Margin of Exposure (MOE) approach. A benchmark dose lower confidence limit for a 10 % excess cancer risk (BMDL10) of 70 µg/kg b.w. per day for induction of liver haemangiosarcomas by lasiocarpine in male rats was calculated as the reference point for comparison with the estimated dietary exposure. The CONTAM Panel concluded that there is a possible health concern for those toddlers and children who are high consumers of honey. There is generally a low risk of PA poisoning in livestock and companion animals in the EU as most PA poisonings reported recently are due to accidental exposure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Chain (CONTAM)","given":"EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food"}],"citation-key":"chaincontam2011","container-title":"EFSA Journal","DOI":"10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2406","ISSN":"1831-4732","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","page":"2406","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Scientific Opinion on Pyrrolizidine alkaloids in food and feed","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2406","volume":"9"},

The objective of this experiment was to examine the expression of genes related to methyl group transfer and lipid metabolism in response to increasing concentrations of choline chloride (CC) and DL-methionine (DLM) in primary neonatal hepatocytes that were or were not exposed to fatty acids (FA). Primary hepatocytes isolated from 4 neonatal Holstein calves were maintained as monolayer cultures for 24 h before treatment with CC (61, 128, 2028, and 4528 μmol/L) and DLM (16, 30, 100, 300 μmol/L), with or without a 1 mmol/L FA cocktail in a factorial arrangement. After 24 h of treatment, media was collected for quantification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and cell lysates were collected for quantification of gene expression. No interactions were detected between CC, DLM, or FA. Both CC and DLM decreased the expression of methionine adenosyltransferase 1A (MAT1A). Increasing CC did not alter betaine-homocysteine S-methyltranferase (BHMT) but did increase 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) expression. Increasing DLM decreased expression of BHMT and MTR, but did not affect MTHFR. Expression of both phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) were decreased by increasing CC and DLM, while carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) was unaffected by either. Treatment with FA decreased the expression of MAT1A, MTR, MTHFR and tended to decrease PEMT but did not affect BHMT and MTTP. Treatment with FA increased CPT1A expression. Increasing CC increased secretion of VLDL and decreased the accumulation of ROS in media. Within neonatal bovine hepatocytes, choline and methionine differentially regulate methyl carbon pathways and suggest that choline may play a critical role in donating methyl groups to support methionine regeneration. Stimulating VLDL export and decreasing ROS accumulation suggests that increasing CC is hepato-protective.","author":[{"family":"Chandler","given":"Tawny L."},{"family":"White","given":"Heather M."}],"citation-key":"Chandler2017","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0171080","ISBN":"1111111111","ISSN":"19326203","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"1-16","PMID":"28152052","title":"Choline and methionine differentially alter methyl carbon metabolism in bovine neonatal hepatocytes","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"Chandler2019","abstract":"Choline and methionine serve essential roles in the liver that may interact with glucose metabolism. Our objectives were to quantify glucose export, cellular glycogen, and expression of genes controlling oxidation and gluconeogenesis in primary bovine neonatal hepatocytes exposed to increasing concentrations of choline chloride (CC) and D,L-methionine (DLM) with or without fatty acids (FA). Primary hepatocytes isolated from 3 Holstein calves were maintained as monolayer cultures for 24 h before treatment with CC (61, 128, 2028, 4528 μmol/L) and DLM (16, 30, 100, 300 μmol/L) with or without a 1 mmol/L FA cocktail in a factorial design. After 24 h, media was harvested to quantify glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and cells harvested to quantify glycogen, DNA, and gene expression. No interactions between CC and DLM were detected. The potential two-way interaction between CC or DLM and FA was partitioned into three contrasts when P < 0.20: linear without FA, linear with FA, difference of slope. Fatty acids did not affect glucose or cellular glycogen but increased pyruvate carboxylase (PC), cytosolic and mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCKc, PEPCKm), and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) expression. Increasing CC decreased glucose but increased cellular glycogen. Expression of PC and PEPCKc was increased by CC during FA treatment. Increasing DLM did not affect metabolites or PC expression, although PEPCKc was marginally decreased. Methionine did not affect G6PC, while CC had a marginal quadratic effect on G6PC. Oxidative and gluconeogenic enzymes appear to respond to FA in primary bovine neonatal hepatocytes. Increased PC and PEPCKc by CC during FA treatment suggest increased gluconeogenic capacity. Changes in G6PC may have shifted glucose-6-phosphate towards cellular glycogen; however, subsequent examination of G6PC protein is needed. Unaltered PC and marginally decreased PEPCKc suggest increased oxidative capacity with DLM, although BHB export was unaltered. The differential regulation supports unique effects of CC and DLM within bovine hepatocytes.","author":[{"family":"Chandler","given":"Tawny L."},{"family":"White","given":"Heather M."}],"citation-key":"Chandler2019","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0217160","ISBN":"1111111111","ISSN":"19326203","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"1-17","title":"Glucose metabolism is differentially altered by choline and methionine in bovine neonatal hepatocytes","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"Chang2015","abstract":"Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) is known to trigger a systemic inflammatory response that is possibly caused by the translocation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream. The aim of this study is to investigate this causal relationship between the increases of circulating LPS and liver inflammation. Here we found that SARA goats exhibited significantly increased LPS concentrations in both the rumen and portal vein. The livers of these goats exhibited increased mRNA concentrations of pro-inflammatory genes that indicated inflammation. Meanwhile, the occurrence of liver inflammation was further validated by the enhanced protein expression of those cytokines in the livers of SARA goats. These increased expressions of detected pro-inflammatory genes were likely mediated by enforced TLR4 signaling because SARA increased the concentrations of TLR4 mRNA and protein in the liver and the abundance of both the NF-kB-p65 factor and its active phosphorylated variant. We also verified that the enhanced TLR4 expression was accompanied by chromatin decompaction and demethylation of the proximal TLR4 promoter. Hence, epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the enforced expression of immune genes during SARA, and these findings open innovative routes for interventions via the modulation of these epigenetic mechanisms.","author":[{"family":"Chang","given":"Guangjun"},{"family":"Zhuang","given":"Su"},{"family":"Seyfert","given":"Hans-Martin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Tianle"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Di"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Junfei"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Xiangzhen"}],"citation-key":"Chang2015","container-title":"Oncotarget","DOI":"10.18632/oncotarget.6161","ISSN":"1949-2553","issue":"36","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"38578-90","PMID":"26498350","title":"Hepatic TLR4 signaling is activated by LPS from digestive tract during SARA, and epigenetic mechanisms contribute to enforced TLR4 expression.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26498350%5Cnhttp://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC4770722","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"Charalambous2010","abstract":"The control of foetal growth is poorly understood and yet it is critically important that at birth the body has attained appropriate size and proportions. Growth and survival of the mammalian foetus is dependent upon a functional placenta throughout most of gestation. A few genes are known that influence both foetal and placental growth and might therefore coordinate growth of the conceptus, including the imprinted Igf2 and Grb10 genes. Grb10 encodes a signalling adapter protein, is expressed predominantly from the maternally-inherited allele and acts to restrict foetal and placental growth. Here, we show that following disruption of the maternal allele in mice, the labyrinthine volume was increased in a manner consistent with a cell-autonomous function of Grb10 and the enlarged placenta was more efficient in supporting foetal growth. Thus, Grb10 is the first example of a gene that acts to limit placental size and efficiency. In addition, we found that females inheriting a mutant Grb10 allele from their mother had larger litters and smaller offspring than those inheriting a mutant allele from their father. This grandparental effect suggests Grb10 can influence reproductive strategy through the allocation of maternal resources such that offspring number is offset against size.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Charalambous","given":"Marika"},{"family":"Cowley","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Geoghegan","given":"Fleur"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Florentia M"},{"family":"Radford","given":"Elizabeth J"},{"family":"Marlow","given":"Benjamin P"},{"family":"Graham","given":"Christopher F"},{"family":"Hurst","given":"Laurence D"},{"family":"Ward","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"Charalambous2010","container-title":"Developmental biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ydbio.2009.10.011","ISSN":"1095-564X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",1,1]]},"page":"1-8","PMID":"19833122","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","title":"Maternally-inherited Grb10 reduces placental size and efficiency.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19833122","volume":"337"},

These were compared in animals with (n=14) and without (n=40) a retained placenta and then according to 2 prepartum diets (corn silage/concentrate, n=44; grass silage/concentrate, n=10) in cows with and without retained placentas. Cows with retained placentas had a 4-day shorter gestation period and gave birth to 5 kg-lighter calves than cows without retained placentas. Furthermore, their plasma PGFM -PgF2α main metabolite- (3325 vs 5675 pg/ml; P<0.01) and glucose (79.2 vs 95.2 mg/100ml; P<0.05) levels were lower and their protein concentration was higher (85.7 vs 76.5 g/l; P<0.05) than those of cows without retained placentas. Retained placenta incidence in cows fed grass-silage was higher than in cows fed corn-silage (60% vs 18.2%; P<0.05). Cows with retained placentas and fed corn silage had shorter gestation lengths, gave birth to lighter calves, and had less circulating glucose at calving (77.6 vs 96.5 mg/100ml; P<0.05) than cows without retained placentas and fed the same forage. Cows with retained placentas and fed grass silage had less PGFM (2172 vs 4530 pg/ml; P<0.05) than cows without retained placentas and fed the same forage. Calving number, sex ratio and preceeding milk yield were not different between the two groups of cows whatever their prepartum diet.

  {"id":"CHAVEZGONZALEZ","abstract":"Mycoplasma bovis and Mycoplasma agalactiae are two very closely related species which cause mastitis in cows and goats, respectively. M. bovis can also cause arthritis and respiratory disease in cattle. It has recently been shown that the 16S rRNA sequences differ only in 8 nucleotide positions between the two species [J.G. Mattsson, B. Guss and K.-E. Johansson (1994) FEMS Microbiol. Lett., 115 : 325-328]. These nucleotide differences are distributed over the molecule in such a way that it is difficult to design specific identification systems, based on PCR only, for M. bovis and M. agalactiae. Two different PCR systems based on 16S rRNA sequence data have, however, been designed for these two species. The forward primers were identical in the two systems and complementary to a segment of the evolutionarily variable region V2. The reverse primers were complementary to the variable region V6, in which there are two nucleotide differences between M. bovis and M. agalactiae. The size of the PCR products, generated with these primers, was 360 bp. Cross-amplification was obtained with the two species in the heterologous PCR systems, but with approximately a 100-fold lower efficiency. Cross-amplification was not obtained with any other bovine or caprine mycoplasma except for Mycoplasma sp. strain A1343 of the caprine group 7. The detection limit of the PCR system for M. bovis with a reference culture was 4 x 102 CFU/ml and of the PCR system for M. agalactiae 2 x 102 CFU/ml.

  {"id":"Chebel2013","abstract":"The objectives of this experiment were to determine the speed at which cows that had their estrous cycle presynchronized with a GnRH or PGF(2α) injection are reinseminated and become pregnant. Furthermore, this experiment aimed to determine whether treatment with a controlled internal drug-releasing (CIDR) insert during the timed artificial insemination (AI) protocol improves pregnancy per AI (P/AI) of cows that had their estrous cycle presynchronized with GnRH or PGF(2α). Lactating cows from 2 herds were assigned to 1 of 2 presynchronization treatments at 32 ± 4 d after AI: GGPG (n=452)--GnRH injection at enrollment (d 0), 7d before the start of the timed AI protocol, and P11GPG (n=466)--PGF(2α) injection on d 3, 11 d before the start of the timed AI protocol. Cows observed in estrus at any interval after enrollment were reinseminated on the same day. Cows not observed in estrus by d 7 were paired by presynchronization treatment and assigned to receive or not receive a CIDR insert during the timed AI protocol (CIDR = 240, no CIDR = 317). Timed AI protocols were the Ovsynch56 at site A and the Cosynch48 at site B. A subsample of cows from site A had their ovaries scanned by ultrasound at enrollment and on the day of the first GnRH and PGF(2α) injections of the timed AI protocol and had blood sampled at each injection of the timed AI protocol for determination of progesterone concentration. Cows were examined for pregnancy 32 ± 4 and 67 ± 4 d after reinsemination. Cows in the P11GPG treatment had a faster reinsemination rate [adjusted hazard ratio = 1.24 (95% CI = 1.07, 1.45)] and were less likely to be submitted to the timed AI protocol (40.3 vs. 89.8%) and to be reinseminated at a fixed time (38.6 vs. 83.9%). The interval from enrollment to reinsemination was shorter for cows in the P11GPG group (13.0 ± 0.4 vs. 15.0 ± 0.2d). Presynchronization treatment did not affect P/AI 32 ± 4 d (GGPG = 42.3%, P11GPG = 39.3%) and 67 ± 4 d (GGPG = 37.0%, P11GPG = 35.4%) after reinsemination. Pregnancy rate from d 0 to 7 (GGPG = 3.6%, P11GPG = 17.7%) and from d 8 to 14 (GGPG = 1.6%, P11GPG = 5.7%) were greater for cows in the P11GPG treatment. Treatment with the CIDR insert during the timed AI protocol did not affect P/AI 32 ± 4 d (CIDR = 41.7%, no CIDR = 41.4%) and 67 ± 4 d (CIDR = 36.5%, no CIDR = 35.3%) after reinsemination. A greater percentage of cows in the GGPG treatment had progesterone concentration ≥ 1 ng/mL on the day of the first GnRH injection of the timed AI protocol (83.8 vs. 51.5%), but a greater percentage of cows in the P11GPG treatment ovulated in response to the first GnRH injection of the timed AI protocol (66.1 vs. 46.8%). We conclude that the P/AI of cows that had their estrous cycle presynchronized with GnRH or PGF(2α) was not different, but in herds with adequate estrous detection efficiency and accuracy, presynchronization with PGF(2α) may reduce the interval to the establishment of pregnancy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Chebel","given":"R C"},{"family":"Scanavez","given":"a","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Silva","given":"P R B"},{"family":"Moraes","given":"J G N"},{"family":"Mendonça","given":"L G D"},{"family":"Lopes","given":"G"}],"citation-key":"Chebel2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5892","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",2]]},"page":"1009-20","PMID":"23219121","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Evaluation of presynchronized resynchronization protocols for lactating dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23219121","volume":"96"},
  {"id":"Chebel2016","abstract":"Management practices during the periparturient period have been the focus of much research recently because during this period immune function, metabolism, and health of cows are severely challenged. Responses to stress are often classified as behavioral, immunological, neuroendocrine, and autonomic. In production systems, understanding all facets of stress response is important to correctly predict the consequences of stressors to the health and performance of animals and to prevent costly managerial changes that have minimal effect on animal well-being and performance. Common social stressors faced by periparturient animals are regrouping, overstocking, and for nulliparous animals, commingling with parous animals. In conventional dairies, feeding strategies during the periparturient period often require several group changes during the most challenging period of an animal’s life. Traditional weekly regrouping of prepartum cows increases competitive behavior at the feed bunk but it does not affect immune and metabolic responses, health and production, as long as stocking density is not overwhelming, and nulliparous and parous animals are housed separately. Stocking density of prepartum animals may be overlooked because these are nonproductive animals. Severe overstocking (200% of feeding space) of commingled nulliparous and parous pregnant animals produces neuroendocrine and metabolic changes. On the other hand, when prepartum nulliparous and parous animals are housed separately, stocking densities of up to 120% do not seem to affect innate and adaptive immunity, metabolic responses, milk yield, and reproductive performance, despite increasing negative behavior among cows. In recent experiments, when animals were ranked based on feed bunk displacement, dominant animals were more likely to be diagnosed with metritis than subordinate animals. Importantly, dominant animals with large number of interactions with pen mates (displacement at the feed bunk) were considerably more likely to be diagnosed with uterine diseases (retained placenta and metritis) and to be removed from the herd within 60d postpartum. Much has been learned about behavioral responses of cows to stressful conditions, but our understanding of neuroendocrine and immune responses to such conditions is somewhat limited. A multidisciplinary approach to research that encompasses several responses to stress and biological functions is critical.","author":[{"family":"Chebel","given":"Ricardo C."},{"family":"Silva","given":"Paula R.B."},{"family":"Endres","given":"Márcia I."},{"family":"Ballou","given":"Michael A."},{"family":"Luchterhand","given":"Karen L."}],"citation-key":"Chebel2016","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2015-10369","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"3217-3228","PMID":"26898274","title":"Social stressors and their effects on immunity and health of periparturient dairy cows","type":"article-journal","volume":"99"},

  {"id":"Chen2019","abstract":"As the precursor to NAD+ and NADP+, niacin is important for catabolic and anabolic redox reactions. In addition, niacin is known for its anti-lipolytic action via a hydroxycarboxylic acid-2-receptor-dependent mechanism. The anti-lipolytic effects of traditional free niacin supplementation during transition periods had been studied extensively, but the reported effects are ambiguous. In the past decade, a series of studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of rumen-protected niacin (RPN) on production performance and metabolic status in early lactation and on heat stress in dairy cows. Feeding RPN seems more effective than free niacin regarding increasing circulating niacin concentration. The rebound of plasma NEFA was found after termination of niacin abomasal infusion. Feeding RPN or infusion of niacin via the abomasum could suppress lipolysis and reduce insulin resistance in early lactation. Additionally, RPN supplementation could possibly relieve heat stress through vasodilation during moderate to severe heat stress condition. However, these beneficial effects of niacin supplementation have not always been observed. The inconsistent results across studies may be related to dosages of niacin supplementation, rebound of plasma NEFA concentration, stage of lactation or severity of heat stress. Overall, the current review is to present updated information on niacin nutrition in dairy cows and the recommendations are given for future research.","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Juncai"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Zhenguo"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Guozhong"}],"citation-key":"Chen2019","container-title":"British Journal of Nutrition","DOI":"10.1017/S0007114519002216","ISSN":"14752662","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"1103-1112","PMID":"31474235","title":"Niacin nutrition and rumen-protected niacin supplementation in dairy cows: An updated review","type":"article-journal","volume":"122"},
  {"id":"cherney2021","abstract":"Objective\nWe evaluated variation in sampling and analysis of forages and quantified day-to-day variation in silages and TMR in typical New York dairy farms.\nMaterials and Methods\nAlfalfa-grass haylage and corn silage samples were collected daily from 7 dairies, for a total of 24 wk for haylage, 22 wk for corn silage, and 16 wk for TMR samples. Multiple samples also were collected at 4 dairies to evaluate both sampling and subsampling variation.\nResults and Discussion\nBased on SD, sampling for DM varied from actual DM by up to ±2 percentage units. Haylage was more variable than corn silage, likely due in part to variability of grass percentage within fields. The most practical parameter to measure for daily rebalancing of rations is DM, and DM had considerable day-to-day variability for haylage, with less variability for corn silage and TMR. Assuming a 7 percentage-unit threshold for a weekly range in DM is great enough to benefit from daily rebalancing, this threshold was exceeded 14% of weeks for corn silage, 25% of weeks for TMR, and 42% of weeks for haylage. A better understanding of day-to-day variability will help determine the accuracy required for on-farm silage moisture determinations.\nImplications and Applications\nNutrient composition of fed rations differs from formulated rations due to day-to-day variation in DM concentration and nutrient composition of forages. Although providing excess feed likely will mitigate the effects of day-to-day silage variability, it not only increases feed costs but also is less environmentally acceptable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Cherney","given":"D.

  {"id":"Choi1997","abstract":"The objective of this study was to improve the efficiency of growth and lactation performance of dairy heifers fed for a stair-step growth pattern. Twenty-four young Holstein heifers were randomly assigned to either control or test groups. The test group was fed according to a schedule of 3, 2, 4, 2, 5 and 2 mo in which feed intake was alternately 20% below or 25% above requirements. Heifers that were subjected to the stair-step growth pattern gained more body weight and consumed less dry matter, resulting in improved efficiency of growth compared with that of controls (7.8% vs. 8.3%). First estrus, first conception, gestation period, services per conception, and calving difficulty (dystocia) were not affected by stair-step growth. Concentration of growth hormone in blood serum was elevated during feed restriction for the test heifers; however, during refeeding, growth hormone was decreased compared with that in the blood serum of control heifers. Mammary tissues obtained by biopsy from heifers in middle and late pregnancy were used for chemical composition analysis. Stair-step growth increased DNA, RNA, protein, the ratio of RNA to DNA, and the ratio of protein to DNA. Lipid decreased in the mammary tissue of test heifers in late pregnancy (9.5 mo). Heifers in the test group yielded approximately 9% more milk than did heifers in the control group. These results indicate that compensatory growth can contribute to the improvement of growth efficiency and lactation performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Choi","given":"Y J"},{"family":"Han","given":"I K"},{"family":"Woo","given":"J H"},{"family":"Lee","given":"H J"},{"family":"Jang","given":"K"},{"family":"Myung","given":"K H"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Y S"}],"citation-key":"Choi1997","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(97)75965-4","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",3]]},"page":"519-24","PMID":"9098802","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Compensatory growth in dairy heifers: the effect of a compensatory growth pattern on growth rate and lactation performance.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9098802","volume":"80"},

A number of different methods have been\ndeveloped for genomic prediction of breeding values,\nbut many of them assume that all animals have been\ngenotyped. In practice, not all animals are\ngenotyped, and the methods have to be adapted to\nthis situation.RESULTS:In this paper we provide an\nextension of a linear mixed model method for genomic\nprediction to the situation with non-genotyped\nanimals. The model specifies that a breeding value\nis the sum of a genomic and a polygenic genetic\nrandom effect, where genomic genetic random effects\nare correlated with a genomic relationship matrix\nconstructed from markers and the polygenic genetic\nrandom effects are correlated with the usual\nrelationship matrix. The extension of the model to\nnon-genotyped animals is made by using the pedigree\nto derive an extension of the genomic relationship\nmatrix to non-genotyped animals. As a result, in the\nextended model the estimated breeding values are\nobtained by blending the information used to compute\ntraditional EBVs and the information used to compute\npurely genomic EBVs. Parameters in the model are\nestimated using average information REML and\nestimated breeding values are best linear unbiased\npredictions (BLUPs).

We derive a similar result for a multivariate response regression with partial least squares. We then propose a sparse partial least squares formulation which aims simultaneously to achieve good predictive performance and variable selection by producing sparse linear combinations of the original predictors.

Dry glycerin was fed at 250 g/d as a top dressing (corresponding to 162.5 g of glycerol/d) to the common lactating total mixed ration from parturition to 21 d postpartum. Individual milk was sampled from 2 consecutive milkings weekly and analyzed for components.

Urine was tested for the acetoacetate level weekly by using Ketostix. Average feed intake, milk yield and components, blood metabolites, and serum insulin concentrations were not affected by dry glycerin supplementation. Glycerin-supplemented cows experienced a more positive energy status (higher concentrations of plasma glucose, lower concentrations of plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate, and lower concentrations of urine ketones), which was observed during the second week of lactation, suggesting that energy availability may have been improved. This glucogenic effect of dry glycerin did not result in an increase in feed intake or milk yield during the first 3 wk of lactation, likely because of the relatively less negative energy status of cows transitioning into lactation. The tendency toward higher milk yield for glycerin-supplemented cows during wk 6 of lactation (52 vs. 46 kg/d) after the supplementation period (dry glycerin was terminated at wk 3 of lactation) suggested a potential benefit of dry glycerin on subsequent milk production, perhaps through changes in metabolism, which requires further investigation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Chung","given":"Y-H"},{"family":"Rico","given":"D E"},{"family":"Martinez","given":"C M"},{"family":"Cassidy","given":"T W"},{"family":"Noirot","given":"V"},{"family":"Ames","given":"a"},{"family":"Varga","given":"G","dropping-particle":"a"}],"citation-key":"Chung2007","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2007-0426","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",12]]},"page":"5682-91","PMID":"18024760","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effects of feeding dry glycerin to early postpartum Holstein dairy cows on lactational performance and metabolic profiles.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18024760","volume":"90"},

Six multiparous (lactation number=1.5±0.8 SD) Holstein dairy cows were at 41 d in milk (±9 SD) at the start of the experiment. Propylene glycol used was a dry product containing 65% PG, and choline was a rumen-protected choline product (RPC; estimated to be 50% rumen-protected) containing 50% choline chloride. In comparison I, treatments compared were 1) control: no PG; 2) PG-TMR: 250g/d of dry PG (corresponding to 162.5g/d of PG) incorporated into the TMR; and 3) PG-top dress: 250g/d of dry PG top-dressed onto the TMR. In comparison II, treatments compared were 1) control: no PG and no RPC; 2) PG: 250g/d of dry PG incorporated into the TMR; 3) RPC: 50g/d of RPC top-dressed onto the TMR; and 4) PG+RPC: combination of treatments 2 and 3. In comparison III, treatments compared were 0, 25, and 50g/d of RPC top-dressed onto the TMR. Each experimental period lasted 10 d with 9 d of adaptation followed by 1 d of serial blood sampling. Dry matter intake and milk yield were recorded daily. During the serial blood sampling, jugular blood was sampled every 20min for the first 4h and at 8 and 12h after treatment administration. Results obtained from comparison I showed that feeding 250g/d of PG as a dry product decreased plasma β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) concentration (mean±SEM) from 701±81 (control) to 564±76μmol/L without affecting serum insulin, plasma glucose, or plasma nonesterified fatty acid concentrations. Top-dressing PG decreased plasma BHBA concentrations more than by incorporating it into the TMR [527 vs. 601μmol/L (± 81 pooled SEM)]. Results obtained from comparison II showed that supplementing choline as RPC, PG, or both had no effect on dry matter intake, milk yield, or any of the blood parameters measured. Results obtained from comparison III showed that milk yield tended to increase linearly with increasing amounts of dietary choline as RPC. We concluded that feeding PG as a dry product reduced plasma BHBA concentration but top-dressing PG was more efficient at reducing plasma BHBA level than incorporating PG into the TMR. Dietary choline as RPC tended to increase milk yield linearly. However, a combined effect of dietary PG and choline was not evident and therefore not beneficial.","author":[{"family":"Chung","given":"Y.-H."},{"family":"Brown","given":"N.E."},{"family":"Martinez","given":"C.M."},{"family":"Cassidy","given":"T.W."},{"family":"Varga","given":"G.A."}],"citation-key":"Chung2009","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2008-1299","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"page":"2729-2736","PMID":"19448007","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effects of rumen-protected choline and dry propylene glycol on feed intake and blood parameters for Holstein dairy cows in early lactation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030209705909","volume":"92"},
  {"id":"Church2008","abstract":"Several recent studies have investigated the effect of shortened dry periods on milk production in the subsequent lactation. What is lacking from these studies is an understanding of the effect that a shortened dry period has on udder health. Four herds, 156 cows, were studied to determine if a shortened dry period (30 d) had a negative effect on mammary gland health during the subsequent lactation as opposed to cows assigned to a long, 45 or 60 d, dry period. Cows in 2 herds were assigned to either 30- or 60-d dry periods (group I), whereas cows in the other 2 herds were assigned to either 30- or 45-d dry periods (group II). Intramammary instillation of commercial preparations of cephapirin benzathine, 300 mg (dry cow formulation), was given to cows assigned a 45- or 60-d dry period length protocol, and 200 mg (lactating cow formulation) was administered to cows assigned a 30-d dry period. Differences in response variables to dry period length were compared within group. Cure rates for 60- vs. 30-d dry period cows were 72% (28/39) vs. 81% (30/37) and 74% (25/34) and 73% (27/37) for 45- vs. 30-d dry periods. Differences were not statistically significant for either comparison group. The majority of intramammary infections were caused by the minor pathogens, coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 102) or Corynebacterium bovis (n = 11). Only 11 cows had intramammary infections by major pathogens. The herd average percentage of new intramammary infections ranged from 6 to 9% and did not differ among herds between treatment groups. Linear somatic cell counts were not significantly affected by dry period length during the first 6 to 7 mo of the subsequent lactation. Milk production did differ between groups. Mature equivalent milk production was greater in group I cows given a 60-d dry period (11,942 +/- 2,059 kg) as opposed to those given a 30-d dry period (10,749 +/- 2,321 kg). Cows given a 45-d dry period did not produce more milk than cows with a 30-d dry period in group II. Although shortening the dry period to 30 d did not have untoward effects on mammary gland health as measured by intramammary infections or milk somatic cell counts, production may be adversely affected when dry periods are shortened to 30 d.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Church","given":"G T"},{"family":"Fox","given":"L K"},{"family":"Gaskins","given":"C T"},{"family":"Hancock","given":"D D"},{"family":"Gay","given":"J M"}],"citation-key":"Church2008","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2008-1377","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",11]]},"page":"4219-25","PMID":"18946126","title":"The effect of a shortened dry period on intramammary infections during the subsequent lactation.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18946126","volume":"91"},

An empirical method is described, based on the concept of a permutation test, for estimating threshold values that are tailored to the experimental data at hand. The method is demonstrated using two real data sets derived from F(2) and recombinant inbred plant populations.

Forty-nine Holstein heifer calves (2±1 d of age) were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: individually housed (G1; n=22) or group housed [3 calves per pen (G3); n=27]. The space allowances per calf were 4.8 and 7.0m(2) for G1 and G3, respectively. All calves were offered an identical plane of milk replacer nutrition (747 and 1,010g of DM/d of a 28% CP:20% fat milk replacer from wk 1 to 2 and wk 3 to 6, respectively). Weaning was initiated during wk 7 by removing the p.m. feeding and calves were completely weaned when they consumed 900g of calf starter/d (as fed) for 2 consecutive days after d 54. At d 90, calves were commingled into random outdoor groups of 5 calves per pen. Peripheral blood was collected during the neonatal (d 3, 10, and 21), weaning (d 46, 48, and 54), and commingling periods (d 90, 93, and 98) and was analyzed for neutrophil oxidative burst (OB) capacity when cocultured with Escherichia coli, neutrophil surface L-selectin protein expression, and whole-blood secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α when cocultured with lipopolysaccharide. Starter intake was greater for G3 during the postweaning period (wk 8 to 12). Average daily gain was greater for G3 than G1 from d 54 to 68 and tended to be greater after commingling from d 113 to 133. During the neonatal period, G3 calves had more activated neutrophils, as evidenced by increased neutrophil L-selectin protein expression and a tendency for increased percentage of neutrophils producing an OB than G1 calves. During weaning, G3 calves continued to have more activated neutrophils with increased L-selectin expression on d 46 and 48 and a greater OB intensity throughout the period. No differences were observed among leukocyte responses between treatments at d 93 and 98.

ROBINSON for estimating genetic variances and the average degree of dominance for quantitative trait loci (QTL) and has recently been extended for mapping QTL. In this paper, we first extend COMSTOCK and ROBINSON's analysis of variance to include linkage, two-locus epistasis and the use of F3 parents. Then we develop the theory and statistical analysis of orthogonal contrasts and contrast x environment interaction for a single marker locus to characterize the effects of QTL. The methods are applied to the maize data of C.W. STUBER. The analyses strongly suggest that there are multiple linked QTL in many chromosomes for several traits examined. QTL effects are largely environment-independent for grain yield, ear height, plant height and ear leaf area and largely environment dependent for days to tassel, grain moisture and ear number. There is significant QTL epistasis. The results are generally in favor of the hypothesis of dominance of favorable genes to explain the observed heterosis in grain yield and other traits, although epistasis could also play an important role and overdominance at individual QTL level can not be ruled out.","author":[{"family":"Cockerham","given":"C C"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Z B"}],"citation-key":"Cockerham1996","container-title":"Genetics","ISSN":"0016-6731","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996",7]]},"page":"1437-56","PMID":"8807314","title":"Design III with marker loci.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1207411&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","volume":"143"},

The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of feeding rations with low dietary P content in late gestation on the Ca homeostasis of the periparturient dairy cow. Eighteen multiparous dairy cows were either fed a P-deficient (0.15% P in dry matter antepartum and 0.20% P in dry matter postpartum) but otherwise balanced ration or a control ration with adequate P content (0.28% P in dry matter antepartum and 0.44% P in dry matter postpartum) during the last 4 wk of gestation until d 10 postpartum. Blood was obtained before initiation of P-deprivation (baseline) and -10, -2, +1, +3, and +10 d relative to parturition to be analyzed for plasma concentrations of Ca [Ca] and inorganic phosphate [Pi]. In addition, plasma concentrations of parathyroid hormone [PTH], the bone resorption marker CrossLaps [CTX], 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were determined in a subset of samples. Feeding a P-deficient diet for 4 wk antepartum positively affected the Ca homeostasis of periparturient cows. Clinical hypocalcemia occurred in 3/9 control and 0/9 P-deprived cows. [Calcium], [PTH], and plasma concentrations of vitamin D metabolites did not differ between groups until parturition, whereas [Pi] was decreased and [CTX] significantly increased in P-deprived animals. At parturition [PTH] was significantly greater in control cows compared with P-depleted cows. The P-deprived cows had significantly higher [Ca] than control cows on d +1 (2.46 ± 0.11 vs. 2.27 ± 0.41 mmol/L) and +2 (2.61 ± 0.13 vs. 2.35 ± 0.25 mmol/L). Plasma [CTX] was significantly higher in P-deprived than in control cows on d +2. Bone resorption and the typical increase in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in periparturient P-deprived cows seemed to occur despite the smaller rise of [PTH], suggesting either greatly increased sensitivity to PTH or bone mobilization independent of PTH.

  {"id":"Colazo2009","abstract":"The objective of this study was to determine the effects of feed restriction and source of dietary fatty acids during the close-up dry period on postcalving reproductive performance of dairy cattle. Thirty-four days before expected calving, pregnant Holstein cows (n = 72; parity 1 to 5) were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatments. Treatments were ad libitum (AL) or 24% feed restriction (FR) in combination with 1 of 3 oilseed supplements at 8% of diet dry matter: canola, linola, or flax to enrich the rations with oleic, linoleic, or linolenic fatty acids, respectively. After calving, cows were fed a common lactation diet that contained no oilseeds. Measurements of uterus, corpus luteum, and follicles were obtained by ultrasonography twice weekly from 7 1 d after calving until the first ovulation. Cows (n = 66) were subjected to timed artificial insemination (TAI), and pregnancy was determined 32 d later. Feed-restricted cows had lower dry matter intake and lost more body weight prepartum. Energy balance (Mcal/d) was negative in FR cows prepartum but they had a less severe negative energy balance postpartum. The dietary source of fatty acid did not affect energy balance. Cows fed AL had a higher incidence of uterine infections (10/37 vs. 2/35) but tended to have fewer ovarian cysts (2/37 vs. 7/35) than FR cows. Mean (+/-SE) interval from calving to uterine involution did not differ among dietary treatments (26.8 1.8 d). Interval from calving to first ovulation was longer in cows fed canola than in those fed either linola or flax (34.7 3.1 vs. 23.7 3.2 and 21.0 3.1 d, respectively). A greater percentage of cows fed AL conceived to the first TAI (47.1 vs. 18.8) and tended to have fewer mean days open (157 10.8 vs. 191 10.1) than cows fed FR. In summary, FR cows had a lower incidence of uterine infections, but they were less fertile as reflected by a lower percent pregnancy to first TAI and increased days open. Cows fed diets enriched in linoleic or linolenic fatty acids had a lesser incidence of ovarian cysts and ovulated sooner with no effect on energy balance or fertility.","author":[{"family":"Colazo","given":"M G"},{"family":"Hayirli","given":"A"},{"family":"Doepel","given":"L"},{"family":"Ambrose","given":"D J"}],"citation-key":"Colazo2009","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"page":"2562-2571","PMID":"19447988","publisher":"Dairy Research and Technology Centre, Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development, Edmonton, Alberta, T6H 5T6, Canada.","title":"Reproductive performance of dairy cows is influenced by prepartum feed restriction and dietary fatty acid source.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19447988","volume":"92"},
  {"id":"Colman2013","abstract":"Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) is one of the most important metabolic disorders, traditionally characterized by low rumen pH, which might be induced by an increase in the dietary proportion of grains as well as by a reduction of structural fiber. Both approaches were used in earlier published experiments in which SARA was induced by replacing part of the ration by a grain mixture or alfalfa hay by alfalfa pellets. The main differences between both experiments were the presence of blood lipopolysaccharide and Escherichia coli and associated effects on the rumen microbial population in the rumen of grain-based induced SARA animals as well as a great amount of quickly fermentable carbohydrates in the grain-based SARA induction experiment. Both induction approaches changed rumen pH although the pH decrease was more substantial in the alfalfa-based SARA induction protocol. The goal of the current analysis was to assess whether both acidosis induction approaches provoked similar shifts in the milk fatty acid (FA) profile. Similar changes of the odd- and branched-chain FA and the C18 biohydrogenation intermediates were observed in the alfalfa-based SARA induction experiment and the grain-based SARA induction experiment, although they were more pronounced in the former. The proportion of trans-10 C18:1 in the last week of the alfalfa-based induction experiment was 6 times higher than the proportion measured during the control week. The main difference between both induction experiments under similar rumen pH changes was the decreasing sum of iso FA during the grain-based SARA induction experiment whereas the sum of iso FA remained stable during the alfalfa-based SARA induction experiment. The cellulolytic bacterial community seemed to be negatively affected by either the presence of E. coli and the associated lipopolysaccharide accumulation in the rumen or by the amount of starch and quickly fermentable carbohydrates in the diet. In general, changes in the milk FA profile were related to changes in rumen pH. Nevertheless, feed characteristics (low in structural fiber vs. high in starch) also affected the milk FA profile and, as such, both effects should be taken into account when subacute acidosis occurs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Colman","given":"E"},{"family":"Khafipour","given":"E"},{"family":"Vlaeminck","given":"B"},{"family":"De Baets","given":"B"},{"family":"Plaizier","given":"J C"},{"family":"Fievez","given":"V"}],"citation-key":"Colman2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-6109","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",4,26]]},"page":"1-12","PMID":"23628250","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Grain-based versus alfalfa-based subacute ruminal acidosis induction experiments: Similarities and differences between changes in milk fatty acids.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23628250","volume":"96"},

  {"id":"Colombini2012","abstract":"Total mixed rations containing corn (CS), whole plant grain sorghum (WPGS), or forage sorghum (FS) silages were fed to 6 primiparous Italian Friesian cows to determine the effects on lactation performance, nutrient digestibility, and N balance. Furthermore, the relationship between in vivo total-tract neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility (ttNDFD) and the ttNDFD derived by the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS) model was assessed. Cows were assigned to 1 of 3 diets in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square with 28-d periods. The experimental treatment was silage type and 3 different silages were included in the diets. The diets were formulated to be iso-NDF. Accordingly, each diet was formulated to contain 41.5% CS silage, 36.7% WPGS silage, or 28.0% FS silage, on a DM basis. Starch content was balanced by adding the appropriate amount of corn meal. Separate collection of total urine and feces was performed. Dietary forages were analyzed for in vitro NDF digestibility (6 and 24h of incubation) to predict fiber digestion rate with 2 NDF pools (digestible and indigestible). Rumen digestibility of the potentially digestible NDF pool was predicted using CNCPS version 6.1, using the in vitro forage fiber digestion rate. The ttNDFD was predicted assuming that intestinal digestibility of the NDF amount escaping rumen digestion was 20%, according to the CNCPS model. Dry matter intake was decreased by approximately 1.8 kg/d in cows fed the FS diet compared with the other diets, probably for the greater particle size of FS diet. Hence, milk yield (kg/d) was lowest for FS (23.6), intermediate for WPGS (24.6), and highest for the CS diet (25.4). Milk urea N (mg/dL) was highest for FS (12.9), intermediate for WPGS (11.9), and lowest for CS (10.7) diet. In vivo ttNDFD (%) was 51.4 (CS), 48.6 (WPGS), and 54.1 (FS); this was probably due to a higher retention time of FS diet in the rumen rather than to a better quality of the FS silage, as confirmed by in situ and in vitro results. Urinary N excretion (% N intake) was highest for FS (31.8), intermediate for WPGS (29.3), and lowest for the CS (27.5) diet.

  {"id":"Cook2012","abstract":"A survey of 65 freestall-housed dairy herds in five different countries, with an average of 1023 milking cows, found that footbaths were used 1-4 times per day for 1-7. days per week, with between 80 and 3000 cows passing through the bath between chemical changes. The most common agents used were copper sulfate (41/65) and formalin (22/65). Twenty-seven herds (42%) used more than one chemical. The median footbath measured 2.03. m long by 0.81. m wide, and was filled to a depth of 0.11. m with a volume of 189. L (range 80-1417. L).An observational behavioral study was conducted using a custom-designed footbath to test four different bath dimensions, with two different step-in heights. The number of immersions per rear foot was counted for each footbath design for each cow passing through the bath on two consecutive days. While a higher step-in height significantly increased the number of foot immersions, the effect was small compared to the effect of length. The probability of each rear foot receiving at least two immersions reached 95% at a bath length of 3.0. m, and a significant increase in the frequency of three and four immersions per foot was observed between 3.0 and 3.7. m. In order to optimize the number of foot immersions per cow pass, while limiting the footbath volume, this study recommends a bath 3.0-3.7. m long, 0.5-0.6. m wide, with a 28. cm step-in height. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","author":[{"family":"Cook","given":"Nigel B."},{"family":"Rieman","given":"J."},{"family":"Gomez","given":"A."},{"family":"Burgi","given":"K."}],"citation-key":"Cook2012","container-title":"Veterinary Journal","DOI":"10.1016/j.tvjl.2012.06.051","ISBN":"1090-0233","ISSN":"10900233","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"669-673","PMID":"22921083","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","title":"Observations on the design and use of footbaths for the control of infectious hoof disease in dairy cattle","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2012.06.051","volume":"193"},

Six mini-silos were prepared in triplicate as follows: 100% red clover (RC), 100% sainfoin (SF), 100% Timothy (T, control without bioactive compounds), binary mixtures 50% T + 50% RC, 50% T + 50% SF and ternary mixture 50% T + 25% RC + 25% SF. Condensed tannins remain unaltered during the silage-making process in terms of quantity and chemical structures, while polyphenol oxidase is activated during this process. All the silages that contained bioactive legumes were better conserved than the pure grass silo. In addition bioactive legumes were able to preserve protein from their degradation during the silage process. Inclusion of bioactive legumes can improve silage quality, and polyphenol oxidase may be more efficient than condensed tannins to improve the nitrogen value of silage.","author":[{"family":"Copani","given":"G."},{"family":"Ginane","given":"C."},{"family":"Le Morvan","given":"A."},{"family":"Niderkorn","given":"V."}],"citation-key":"Copani2014","container-title":"Animal Production Science","DOI":"10.1071/AN14252","ISSN":"18365787","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"1826-1829","title":"Bioactive forage legumes as a strategy to improve silage quality and minimise nitrogenous losses","type":"article-journal","volume":"54"},

Rumen fermentation parameters, namely DM disappearance, volatile fatty acids (VFA), ammonia (NH<inf>3</inf>), gas production and methane (CH<inf>4</inf>) were determined. The presence of RC in mixtures with T or T-SF results in fermentation similar to pure T and a positive associative effect between T and RC on total VFA production was observed (P=0.029). The NH<inf>3</inf>: total N ratio was similar among the treatments, but lower values for NH<inf>3</inf>: insoluble N ratio in silages containing SF or RC (P<0.05, except for T-SF) indicates that the bioactive compounds can limit silage protein degradation in the rumen. The CH<inf>4</inf> production per g of DM only tended to differ among treatments (P=0.096), being slightly lower for pure SF than for pure T and RC, probably due to differences in the fermentation pathways towards less acetate and butyrate productions.

The treatments were for ad libitum intake: a control diet with no flaxseed products (CON) or a diet of 42. g/kg dry matter (DM) whole flaxseed (FLA), 19. g/kg DM calcium salts of flaxseed oil (SAL) or 23. g/kg DM whole flaxseed and 8. g/kg DM calcium salts of flaxseed oil (MIX). Experimental periods consisted of 21 d of diet adaptation and 7. d of data collection and sampling. Intake of α-linolenic acid (cis9,12,15-18:3) was similar for cows fed FLA, SAL, and MIX and higher than for those fed CON. Output of linolenic acid in faeces was higher for cows fed FLA, followed by those fed MIX, CON, and SAL. Output of α-linolenic acid in milk tended (P=0.07) to be lower for cows fed CON than for those fed the other diets and there was no difference between cows fed FLA, SAL, and MIX. Although intake of α-linolenic acid was lower for cows fed CON than for those fed the other diets, transfer efficiency (g per 100. g of α-linolenic acid consumed) was higher for cows fed the former diet. Feeding FLA, SAL, and MIX resulted in similar apparent transfer of α-linolenic acid in milk. Cows fed FLA had the lowest TTAD of linolenic acid. The high digestibility of Ca-salts of flaxseed oil accounts for the interest in using it in practical applications for feeding cows.

  {"id":"costerImprintedGeneDIO32012","abstract":"Genomic imprinting is an important epigenetic phenomenon, which on the phenotypic level can be detected by the difference between the two heterozygote classes of a gene. Imprinted genes are important in both the development of the placenta and the embryo, and we hypothesized that imprinted genes might be involved in female fertility traits. We therefore performed an association study for imprinted genes related to female fertility traits in two commercial pig populations. For this purpose, 309 SNPs in fifteen evolutionary conserved imprinted regions were genotyped on 689 and 1050 pigs from the two pig populations. A single SNP association study was used to detect additive, dominant and imprinting effects related to four reproduction traits; total number of piglets born, the number of piglets born alive, the total weight of the piglets born and the total weight of the piglets born alive. Several SNPs showed significant (q-value<0.10) additive and dominant effects and one SNP showed a significant imprinting effect. The SNP with a significant imprinting effect is closely linked to DIO3, a gene involved in thyroid metabolism. The imprinting effect of this SNP explained approximately 1.6% of the phenotypic variance, which corresponded to approximately 15.5% of the additive genetic variance. In the other population, the imprinting effect of this QTL was not significant (q-value>0.10)but had a similar effect as in the first population.

Three distinct methods were used to calculate MEBV: a Bayesian Method (BM), Least Angle Regression (LARS) and Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR). The accuracy of MEBV calculated with BM and LARS decreased when the number of simulated QTL increased. The accuracy decreased more when QTL had different variance values than when all QTL had an equal variance. The accuracy of MEBV calculated with PLSR was affected neither by the number of QTL nor by the distribution of QTL variance. Additional simulations and analyses showed that these conclusions were not affected by the number of individuals in the training population, by the number of markers and by the heritability of the trait.

  {"id":"Craig2020","abstract":"A three-period change-over design study using 24 mid-lactation multiparous Holstein-Friesian dairy cows, examined supplementation strategies for a high quality grass silage (dry matter (DM), 418 g/kg; crude protein (CP), 170 g/kg DM; metabolisable energy (ME), 12.1 MJ/kg DM). Four treatments, in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, compared concentrate type (High-starch or High-fibre) and straw inclusion (Straw or No-straw). Concentrates had a starch and neutral detergent fibre content of 373 and 258 g/kg DM, respectively (High-starch), and 237 and 339 g/kg DM, respectively (High-fibre). In the No-straw treatments, silage and concentrates were offered as a total mixed ration in a 57:43 DM ratio. In the Straw treatments, chopped straw was added at 4% of total DM, replacing part of the silage component of the diet. Following this study, the effect of diet on nutrient utilisation efficiency was examined using four cows/treatment. There were no interactions between concentrate type and straw inclusion for any cow performance or digestibility parameters. Silage dry matter intake (DMI) and total DMI were reduced with the High-fibre concentrate (P = 0.001 and P = 0.006, respectively) and straw inclusion (P < 0.001 and P = 0.014, respectively). Neither concentrate type nor straw inclusion had a significant effect on milk yield or milk fat content. The High-starch concentrate increased milk protein content (P < 0.001), while straw inclusion decreased milk protein content (P = 0.036). Treatment had no effect on cow body weight, condition score, faecal scores, digestibility coefficients or nitrogen and energy utilisation efficiency. In conclusion, supplementing a high quality grass silage with a carefully formulated ‘high starch’ concentrate improved DMI and milk protein content with no adverse effects on cow performance. Straw inclusion in the diet had no beneficial effects on DMI, milk production or nutrient utilisation efficiency.","author":[{"family":"Craig","given":"A."},{"family":"Gordon","given":"A.

  {"id":"Daetwyler2010","abstract":"The rapid increase in high-throughput single-nucleotide polymorphism data has led to a great interest in applying genome-wide evaluation methods to identify an individual's genetic merit. Genome-wide evaluation combines statistical methods with genomic data to predict genetic values for complex traits. Considerable uncertainty currently exists in determining which genome-wide evaluation method is the most appropriate. We hypothesize that genome-wide methods deal differently with the genetic architecture of quantitative traits and genomes. A genomic linear method (GBLUP), and a genomic nonlinear Bayesian variable selection method (BayesB) are compared using stochastic simulation across three effective population sizes and a wide range of numbers of quantitative trait loci (N(QTL)). GBLUP had a constant accuracy, for a given heritability and sample size, regardless of N(QTL). BayesB had a higher accuracy than GBLUP when N(QTL) was low, but this advantage diminished as N(QTL) increased and when N(QTL) became large, GBLUP slightly outperformed BayesB. In addition, deterministic equations are extended to predict the accuracy of both methods and to estimate the number of independent chromosome segments (M(e)) and N(QTL). The predictions of accuracy and estimates of M(e) and N(QTL) were generally in good agreement with results from simulated data. We conclude that the relative accuracy of GBLUP and BayesB for a given number of records and heritability are highly dependent on M(e,) which is a property of the target genome, as well as the architecture of the trait (N(QTL)).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",8,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Daetwyler","given":"Hans D"},{"family":"Pong-Wong","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Villanueva","given":"Beatriz"},{"family":"Woolliams","given":"John","dropping-particle":"a"}],"citation-key":"Daetwyler2010","container-title":"Genetics","DOI":"10.1534/genetics.110.116855","ISSN":"1943-2631","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",7]]},"page":"1021-31","PMID":"20407128","title":"The impact of genetic architecture on genome-wide evaluation methods.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2907189&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","volume":"185"},

  {"id":"dairexnetprotein2010","abstract":"This fact sheet has been developed to support the implementation of the Natural Resources Conservation Service Feed Management 592 Practice Standard. The Feed Management 592 Practice Standard was adopted by NRCS in 2003 as another tool to assist with addressing resource concerns on livestock and poultry operations. Feed management can assist with reducing the import of nutrients to the farm and reduce the excretion of nutrients in manure. The Natural Resources Conservation Service has adopted a practice standard called Feed Management (592) and is defined as “managing the quantity of available nutrients fed to livestock and poultry for their intended purpose”. The national version of the practice standard can be found in a companion fact sheet entitled “An Introduction to Natural Resources Feed Management Practice Standard 592”. Please check in your own state for a state-specific version of the standard. Nitrogen (N) is the building block of proteins in feeds and forages. Protein is typically the most expensive component of the purchased feeds used in dairy rations. Nitrogen is also receiving more attention as a component of nutrient management plans on dairy farms and potential ammonia emissions. Understanding how N is used in dairy cattle is important in improving both profitability and decreasing excretion from the cow into the environment. It is important to remember that dairy cows do not have a protein requirement. They really need amino acids available in the small intestine to support tissue growth and milk production. Basically, N utilization in dairy cattle is composed of two components. The first is providing an adequate supply of N and carbohydrates in the rumen to support the growth of rumen microorganisms and the production of microbial crude protein (MCP). The second part of the system is the utilization of amino acids in the small intestine to provide for the needs of the cow.","citation-key":"dairexnetprotein2010","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"title":"Understanding Nitrogen Utilization in Dairy Cattle","type":"report","URL":"http://www.extension.org/pages/11329/understanding-nitrogen-utilization-in-dairy-cattle#Protein_Systems"},

  {"id":"Damgaard2013","abstract":"High-producing dairy cows experience a sudden and significant increase in energy requirements due to the onset of milk production in early lactation. They mobilize body reserves, mainly adipose tissue, resulting in an increased risk of production decline and the development of health disorders. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of feeding oilseeds (rapeseed) during the dry period, thereby priming dairy cows for metabolism of body fat in early lactation. Forty-three Holstein dairy cows were used, 14 were primiparous and 29 were multiparous (≥2nd lactation). In the dry period, 8 wk before expected calving until calving, the cows were fed either a diet with a high content of rapeseed in the total mixed ration (HF) or a standard total mixed ration with a low content of fat (CON). During the first 5 wk after calving, all the cows were fed a standard low fat lactation ration. The treatments were evaluated by performance and metabolic variables in blood and liver. The dry period diet had no effects on body weight and body condition score of the cows during the dry period and in early lactation. The daily yield of milk, protein, and lactose did not differ among treatments. However, the milk fat concentration was lower and the daily milk fat production tended to be lower for the cows fed the HF diet in the dry period compared with the cows fed the CON diet. The plasma content of nonesterified fatty acids, cholesterol, and phospholipids in the dry period was increased in the HF dry period diet compared with the CON diet. The lower plasma concentration of uric acid obtained prepartum for the cows fed the HF diet may indicate a lower rumen microbial protein synthesis. Postpartum, the plasma concentration of β-hydroxybutyric acid tended to be lower for the cows fed the HF dry period diet. The liver content of triglycerides was lower and the liver content of glycogen was higher in early lactation among the cows fed the HF dry period diet compared with the cows fed the CON diet. Based on liver glycogen, triglyceride content, and blood β-hydroxybutyric acid concentration, it could be argued that intake of oilseeds during the dry period is a positive strategy for priming dairy cows for fat metabolism in the following early lactation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Damgaard","given":"B M"},{"family":"Weisbjerg","given":"M R"},{"family":"Larsen","given":"T"}],"citation-key":"Damgaard2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-6055","ISSN":"1525-3198","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",4,19]]},"page":"1-10","PMID":"23608494","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Priming the cow for lactation by rapeseed supplementation in the dry period.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23608494"},

The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of different supplemental trace mineral strategies on apparent total-tract digestibility, rumen fermentation, and dairy productivity. Using 52 Holstein cows in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with periods of 21 d, 4 treatments differing in their sources of Cu, Zn, and Mn were tested: sulfate form, hydroxychloride form, a mix of sulfate and organic chelate forms (70 and 30%, respectively), and a mix of hydroxychloride and organic chelate forms (70 and 30%, respectively). Treatments were formulated to provide 15, 40, and 20 mg of supplemental Cu, Zn, and Mn, respectively, per kilogram of dry matter. This level of supplementation, together with the basal level present in forages and feed ingredients, resulted in a total average supply of 19, 79, and 84 mg of Cu, Zn, and Mn, respectively, per kilogram of dry matter. Cows had ad libitum access to a total mixed ration, which provided 15.3% of crude protein, 21.7% of starch, and 35.3% of neutral detergent fiber (NDF). Data were summarized by period with trace minerals and period as fixed effects and the repeated cow as random effect using the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Apparent total-tract NDF and crude protein digestibility was reduced (−0.8% and −1.0%, respectively) when organic chelate trace minerals were fed, whereas apparent total-tract NDF digestibility was improved (+0.8%) when sulfate trace minerals were replaced by hydroxychloride trace minerals. Cows supplemented with the hydroxychloride source had lower ruminal butyric acid concentration compared with cows fed sulfate trace minerals (13.3 vs. 14.6%). In addition, fat- and protein-corrected milk and milk fat yields were improved (+1.0 kg/d and +51 g/d, respectively) in multiparous cows when trace minerals were supplemented as hydroxychloride compared with sulfate. These effects were not observed in primiparous cows. These results confirm that trace mineral sources affect apparent total-tract digestibility and indicate that milk productivity may also be affected.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Daniel","given":"J.

  {"id":"Dann2006","abstract":"Three experiments were conducted to determine (1) the dose of glutamate needed to alter fermentation and nitrogen (N) partitioning in a continuous culture system, (2) the effect of supplemental glutamate in diets varying in rumen-undegradable protein on fermentation and N partitioning in a continuous culture system, and (3) the effect of dietary supplemental glutamate on the lactational performance of mid-lactation dairy cows, total tract nutrient digestibility, and ruminal microbial N synthesis. In experiment 1, the equivalent of 0, 40, or 80 g of supplemental glutamate per cow per day was added to a basal diet. The dietary treatments were evaluated in a continuous culture system. Glutamate decreased protein digestion and microbial growth while increasing non-ammonia, non-microbial N. Within the doses tested, the equivalent of 80 g glutamate per cow per day most effectively increased non-ammonia, non-microbial N. In experiment 2, dietary treatments consisted of diets formulated to have low rumen-undegradable protein (LRUP; 62 g/kg DM), low rumen-undegradable protein plus the equivalent of 80 g glutamate per cow per day (LRUP + G), and high rumen-undegradable protein [HRUP; 68 g/kg dry matter (DM)]. The dietary treatments were evaluated in a continuous culture system. When added to a diet low in rumen-undegradable protein, glutamate tended to decrease DM and organic matter (OM) digestibility, decreased total volatile fatty acid (VFA) production, increased fermenter pH, increased feed N converted to microbial N, and had no effect on microbial N production. The LRUP + G diet was similar to the HRUP diet and different from the LRUP diet in feed N converted to microbial N and ammonia N concentration. In experiment 3, 40 Holstein cows were utilized in a crossover study to test the effects of two dietary treatments: 0 or 80 g of supplemental glutamate per cow per day. The addition of glutamate to the diet of lactating dairy cows did not improve lactational performance or nutrient digestibility.

  {"id":"DaSilva2005","abstract":"The increased frequency of diseases, especially those of the hoof, cause economic losses, such as premature culling of affected animals, decreased milk production, weight loss, reduced fertility, and the high costs of treatment. A great variety of hoof conditions may affect cattle, one of them is digital dermatitis. These conditions are probably due to multiple factorial diseases and present with similar clinical signs. Bovine lameness is typically treated by foot trimming and debridment of the lesions, coupled when necessary with systemic antibiotics and therapeutic footbaths, which results in a clinical cure in the majority of the cases. The objective of this study was to evaluate the topical action of sodium hypochlorite associated with the systemic use of oxytetracycline for the treatment of wounds clinically diagnosed as bovine digital dermatitis. One hundred and twenty Holstein cattle varying ages from 1 to 9 y and presenting the clinical signs of digital dermatitis, were used in this study. Group 1 (G1) received topical treatment with a 1% sodium hypochlorite footbath twice a day for 30 d and 4 treatments of parenteral oxytetracycline (10 mg/kg bodyweight, IM, q48h). Group 2 (G2) received only the topical treatment with 1% sodium hypochlorite, as described for G1. Group 3 (G3) received only with parenteral oxytetracycline, as described for G1. Group 4 (G4) was treated exclusively with a dicloro divynil pirrolidona, ortoiododimetil, para-nitofenil-fosforotioato in a vegetal tar-based ointment, immediately after the surgery. After 45 d, the recovery rates were as follows: G1, 86.67%; G2, 73.33%; G3, 56.67%; and G4, 50%. The surgical treatment of digital dermatitis with subsequent treatment with oxytetracycline systemically and 1% sodium hypochlorite topically was the most effective for the convalescence of cattle bearing wounds similar to digital dermatitis.","author":[{"family":"Silva","given":"Luiz Antônio Franco","non-dropping-particle":"da"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Carla A."},{"family":"Borges","given":"José R J"},{"family":"Fioravanti","given":"Maria C S"},{"family":"Borges","given":"Gabriela T."},{"family":"Atayde","given":"Ingrid B."}],"citation-key":"DaSilva2005","container-title":"Canadian Veterinary Journal","ISBN":"0008-5286 (Print)","ISSN":"00085286","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"page":"345-348","PMID":"15943122","title":"A clinical trial to assess the use of sodium hypochlorite and oxytetracycline on the healing of digital dermatitis lesions in cattle","type":"article-journal","volume":"46"},

  {"id":"Davies1998","abstract":"The effect of contrasting concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrates of herbage on silage fermentation and composition was examined using grass with high [250 g/kg of dry matter (DM)] concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrates and grass and clover with low (66 g/kg of DM) concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrates. Herbages were ensiled untreated, after inoculation with lactic acid bacteria, or after treatment with formic acid. Good quality silages were produced from herbage with high concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrates, regardless of treatment, and all pH values were below 3.7 after 90 d of ensilage. However, the silage formed from inoculated herbage had a significantly lower concentration of ammonia N and a significantly higher proportion of residual ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase compared with the other two silages. Fast protein liquid chromatography (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to measure ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, and measurement of true plant protein fractions in herbage and silage showed benefits over traditional measurements such as the measurement of N and ammonia N. Herbages with low concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrates produced inferior quality silages that had lower ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase contents and higher ammonia N contents, regardless of treatment; few significant differences were observed among treatments. Under good ensiling conditions, when available water-soluble carbohydrate is adequate, the use of inoculants can improve fermentation characteristics and increase the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase content of silages. However, when the herbage has low concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrates, even in inoculated herbages, lactic acid bacteria may follow a heterofermentative pathway instead of a homofermentative pathway, which can result in a decrease in silage quality and a reduction in intact ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase.","author":[{"family":"Davies","given":"D.R."},{"family":"Merry","given":"R.J."},{"family":"Williams","given":"A.P."},{"family":"Bakewell","given":"E.L."},{"family":"Leemans","given":"D.K."},{"family":"Tweed","given":"J.K.S."}],"citation-key":"Davies1998","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(98)75596-1","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"page":"444-453","PMID":"9532499","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Proteolysis During Ensilage of Forages Varying in Soluble Sugar Content","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030298755961","volume":"81"},

  {"id":"DeCampeneere2006","abstract":"The effect of three wheat grain treatments on the zootechnical performance (feed intake, milk production and milk fat and protein production) of dairy cattle was studied with 18 Holstein cows in each of two feeding trials (both a 3 ?? 3 Latin square design). Rolled wheat, NaOH treated wheat and immature wheat ensiled with Graintona-Plus (Vee-lik, Zuienkerke, Belgium) were compared in a ration with fixed DM proportions of wheat, maize silage and prewilted grass silage. The nutritive value of the three wheat treatments was derived from in situ rumen degradability studies and from in vivo digestibility experiments. In situ rumen incubations showed that NaOH treatment strongly decreased protein and starch degradability of the wheat. Due to that importantly decreased starch degradability NaOH treated wheat may be a source of starch with a reduced risk of rumen acidosis as compared to rolled wheat. On the other hand, due to the ensiling, immature wheat had a very high washable starch fraction, despite the Graintona-Plus treatment. The protein value differed importantly, with the DPI (true protein digested in the small intestine; [Tamminga, S., van Straalen, W.M., Subnel, A.P.J., Meijer, R.G.M., Steg, A., Wever, C.J.G., Blok, M.C., 1994.

In Trial 1, all diets were formulated to supply 105% of the requirements of DPI and net energy lactation (NEL; [Van Es, A.J.H., 1978. Feed evaluation for ruminants: I.

Following trial 1, trial 2 was carried out, with the maize silage, grass silage and wheat fed in the same proportions as in trial 1, but fed ad libitum, to compare the intake level of the three diets. In both trials, the NaOH treated wheat resulted in the best performance with importantly increased milk yield and the highest yield of fat and protein corrected milk. Ensiled immature wheat resulted in a significant lower milk production and milk protein yield and in a higher milk fat content. In trial 1, DM-intake of the three groups was comparable due to the experimental design.

Blood samples (n=400) were collected from calves at 3 to 6d of age. Serum IgG concentration was determined by radial immunodiffusion (RID), and STP and percentage Brix (%Brix) were determined using a digital refractometer. The mean IgG concentration was 24.1g/L [standard deviation (SD) ± 10.0] with a range from 2.1 to 59.1g/L. The mean STP concentration was 6.0g/dL (SD ± 0.8) with a range from 4.4 to 8.8g/dL. The mean %Brix concentration was 9.2% (SD ± 0.9) with a range of 7.3 to 12.4%. Brix percentage was highly correlated with IgG (r=0.93). Test characteristics were calculated to assess failure of passive transfer (FPT; serum IgG <10g/L). The sensitivity and specificity of STP at 5.5g/dL were 76.3 and 94.4%, respectively. A receiver operating characteristic curve was created to plot the true positive rate against the false positive rate for consecutive %Brix values. The optimal combination of sensitivity (88.9%) and specificity (88.9%) was at 8.4% Brix. Serum total protein was also positively correlated with %Brix (r=1.00) and IgG (r=0.93).

No such changes or any other indications of toxicity were observed, however, upon feeding much higher levels of LAL (up to 6,000 ppm) when provided as the protein-bound compound in alkali-treated casein or soybean protein. When set free by complete acid hydrolysis, LAL induced considerable renal activity, comparable to that of the synthetic compound. These results indicate that alkali treatment of proteins does not induce nephrotoxic properties provided that the compound remains protein-bound. Some nephrotoxic activity was observed, however, with peptide-boound LAL in break-down products (molecular weight less than 5,000) of alkali-treated casein, but considerably less than that of the free compound. LAL-analyses in blood, urine, and feces of rats fed free or protein-bound LAL indicated a positive correlation between intestinal absorption and nephrotoxic potential.

  {"id":"dehaas2007","abstract":"The aim of this study was to define alternative traits of somatic cell count (SCC) that can be used to decrease genetic susceptibility to clinical and subclinical mastitis (CM and SCM, respectively). Three kinds of SCC traits were evaluated: 1) lactation-averages of SCC, 2) traits derived from the proportion of test-day SCC above 150,000 cells/mL, and 3) patterns of peaks in SCC. Genetic parameters for these SCC traits and their genetic correlation with CM and SCM were estimated; CM and SCM were scored as binary traits. Two data sets (A and B) depending on CM recording were available. After editing, subset A contained 28,688 lactations from 21,673 cows in 394 herds. Subset B contained 56,726 lactations of 30,145 cows in 272 herds. Variance components for sire and permanent animal effects were estimated. Estimated heritabilities for all mastitis traits were around 0.03. Heritabilities for SCC traits ranged from 0.01 for patterns of peaks in SCC to 0.13 for lactation-average SCC. Genetic correlations between SCC traits and CM or SCM ranged from 0.55 to 0.93 for CM and from 0.55 to 0.98 for SCM. High genetic correlations were estimated between CM and SCC averaged over 250 d in milk (0.87), and between SCM and presence of test-day SCC >150,000 cells/mL (0.98) in subset A. In subset B, a high genetic correlation was estimated between CM and an SCC peak with a quick recovery (0.93) and between SCM and SCC averaged between 151 and 400 d (0.95). Partial genetic correlations were calculated to investigate the additional information of the alternative SCC traits, compared with lactation-average SCC. They showed that some traits remain informative for CM and others for SCM.

  {"id":"Dehghan-banadaky2007","abstract":"Barley grain is one of the most common feed grains used in diets for dairy and beef cattle. Because the endosperm of the barley kernel is surrounded by the pericarp, which is extremely resistant to microbial degradation in the rumen, dry barley grain needs to be processed to improve its utilization by beef and dairy cattle. Dry rolling is a common processing method, and increases ruminal digestibility of grain and productivity of animals, but the grain kernels often shatter during processing, producing many fine particles, which has been associated with inconsistent animal performance. Steam rolling and temper rolling can reduce production of fine particles during rolling, allowing more uniform particle size distribution. Steam flaking uses moisture, heat and pressure to gelatinize starch granules, but positive effects of starch gelatinization on animal performance may be less for barley grain versus corn or sorghum because barley starch, once exposed to microbial organisms in the rumen, is readily degradable even without being gelatinized. Treatment of grains with NaOH may increase its ruminal starch digestibility without increasing ruminal rate of starch release. Roasting and aldehyde treatment decrease the rate of crude protein degradation and optimize organic matter degradation in the rumen, while application of ammonia or fibrolytic enzymes can increase degradation of the hull. Consistency in processed grain quality (e.g., particle size) and predictability in animal performance should be considered as an important quality parameter of processing. In addition, initial grain quality, extent of processing, processing method, and their interactions, determine the feeding value of barley grain and affect the productivity of cattle. Further research is warranted to develop a common quality parameter accounting for variations in physical, chemical and biochemical properties for processed barley grain. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  {"id":"DeKoning2000","abstract":"The role of imprinting in body composition was investigated in an experimental cross between Chinese Meishan pigs and commercial Dutch pigs. A whole-genome scan revealed significant evidence for five quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting body composition, of which four were imprinted. Imprinting was tested with a statistical model that separated the expression of paternally and maternally inherited alleles. For back fat thickness, a paternally expressed QTL was found on Sus scrofa chromosome 2 (SSC2), and a Mendelian-expressed QTL was found on SSC7. In the same region of SSC7, a maternally expressed QTL affecting muscle depth was found. Chromosome 6 harbored a maternally expressed QTL on the short arm and a paternally expressed QTL on the long arm, both affecting intramuscular fat content. The individual QTL explained from 2% up to 10% of the phenotypic variance. The known homologies to human and mouse did not reveal positional candidate genes. This study demonstrates that testing for imprinting should become a standard procedure to unravel the genetic control of multifactorial traits.","author":[{"family":"Koning","given":"D J","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Rattink","given":"a P"},{"family":"Harlizius","given":"B"},{"family":"Arendonk","given":"J","non-dropping-particle":"van","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Brascamp","given":"E W"},{"family":"Groenen","given":"M","dropping-particle":"a"}],"citation-key":"DeKoning2000","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.140216397","ISSN":"0027-8424","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",7,5]]},"page":"7947-50","PMID":"10859367","title":"Genome-wide scan for body composition in pigs reveals important role of imprinting.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=16650&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","volume":"97"},

The effect of insulin on the glucose metabolism is regulated by the secretion of insulin by the pancreas and the insulin sensitivity of the skeletal muscles, the adipose tissue, and the liver.

Among all methods, liquid chromatography is considered suitable for detection and quantification of biogenic amines in different food matrices. However, variations in the process of sample preparation, extraction, derivatization, and instrumental conditions according to the food evaluated (honey, meat in different species, milk, and others) are reported in the literature.

BSG is rich in carbohydrates, lignin, proteins and lipids. In this work, the chemical composition of the lipids in BSG was studied in detail by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The predominant lipids were triglycerides (67% of total extract), followed by a series of free fatty acids (18%). Lower amounts of monoglycerides (1.6%) and diglycerides (7.7%) were also identified among the lipids in BSG, together with minor amounts of other aliphatic series such as n-alkanes and alkylresorcinols. Steroid compounds (steroid hydrocarbons, steroid ketones, free sterols, sterol esters and sterol glycosides) were also found in important amounts in BSG (ca. 5%), with free and conjugated sterols being the most abundant steroids.

  {"id":"Deming2012","abstract":"The objective of this cross-sectional study was to describe the housing, feeding management, and characteristics (parity and stage of lactation) of cows on commercial automatic milking system (AMS) dairies and their associations with the standing and lying behavior patterns and milking activity (frequency and yield) of lactating dairy cows. Thirteen AMS herds were enrolled in the study, with an average herd size of 71±30 (mean ± SD; range: 34 to 131) lactating cows. All of the herds used freestall barns, each set up for free cow traffic to the AMS. On-farm measurements were taken to determine stocking density at the freestalls (0.9±0.1 cows/stall; mean ± SD), feed bunk (0.66±0.17m of feed bunk space/cow; mean ± SD), and AMS units (55±11 cows/AMS; mean ± SD). A random sample of 30 cows/herd was selected to monitor standing and lying behavior for 4d using electronic data loggers. Times of feed delivery and feed push-up were recorded daily by the herd managers. Milking times, frequency, and yield were automatically recorded by the AMS units. Data were analyzed in a multivariable mixed regression model to determine which herd-level (housing and feeding management) and cow-level (parity, DIM, and milk yield) factors were associated with behavior and milking activity measures. Lying bout lengths were found to be negatively associated with milk yield and tended to be positively associated with more space at the feed bunk. Increased lying duration was associated with cows of lower milk production, increased space at the feed bunk, and increased frequency of feed push-up. Longer postmilking standing durations were associated with cows of higher parity. An association existed between cows milking less frequently when they were further in lactation, were of higher parity, and as stocking density at the AMS (cows/AMS) increased. Milk yield was positively associated with increased space at the feed bunk and higher parity and negatively associated with DIM. From this study, it can be concluded that increased milking frequency may be achieved in AMS herds by reducing stocking density at the AMS unit. Further, in AMS systems, greater milk yield and lying duration may be achieved by ensuring that cows have ample feed bunk space and have their feed readily available to them in the bunk.","author":[{"family":"Deming","given":"J.A."},{"family":"Bergeron","given":"R."},{"family":"Leslie","given":"K.E."},{"family":"DeVries","given":"T.J."}],"citation-key":"Deming2012","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5985","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"344-351","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Associations of housing, management, milking activity, and standing and lying behavior of dairy cows milked in automatic systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-5985","volume":"96"},

The experimental design was completely randomized in a double factorial arrangement with one additional treatment: 4 urease source levels x 3 urease sources + 1 control. Chemical-bromatological analyses and carbohydrate fractionation were performed in the hay, and cumulative gas production in vitro was determined. There were interactions between urease level and source for neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber, in which 1 and 2% jack bean lowered acid detergent fiber values, and 2% jack bean and 3% soybean reduced lignin content. The addition of milled legume grains reduces fiber components and increases non protein nitrogen content in elephant grass hay ammoniated with urea. Adding 4% milled soybean increases gas production in the soluble fraction.Resumo: O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o efeito da inclusão de soja (Glycine max), feijão-guandu (Cajanus cajan) e feijão-de-porco (Canavalia ensiformis) como fonte de urease para feno de capim-elefante (Pennisetum purpureum) amonizado com ureia.

  {"id":"DeOndarza2017","abstract":"Interactions among diet nutrient parameters can influence dairy cattle response to added dietary sugar. With the objective to evaluate the effect of dietary sugar, 2 data sets with dietary information and production responses were compiled from published research that tested the effect of additional dietary sugar on dairy cattle performance. The first data set included 24 scientific papers (97 observations) with dietary forage NDF content ranging from 14.61 to 38.48% of diet DM. To evaluate the effect of dietary sugar in diets with a more narrow range in dietary forage NDF (17.37 to 29.51% of diet DM), the second data set omitted 3 of the scientific papers in the first data set, resulting in 85 observations. Mixed model linear regression analysis included treatment category [control, 1.5–3%, 3–5%, vs. 5–7% added dietary sugar (% of diet DM)], DIM category within treatment, control milk yield category within treatment, and several continuous nutrient variables. In cows producing >33 kg of milk/d, added dietary sugar had a greater response (2.14 kg of 3.5% FCM/d; P < 0.0001) than in cows producing <33 kg of milk (0.77 kg of 3.5% FCM/d). Additional dietary sugar did not affect milk fat or protein percentage (P > 0.15). Nutrient variables with a positive effect on 3.5% FCM yield included added starch and protein B2 (insoluble in boiling neutral detergent but soluble in boiling acid detergent solution). Nonlinear statistical analysis predicted the optimal total dietary sugar to be 6.75% of diet DM. To optimize 3.5% FCM yield response when feeding additional dietary sugars, a low to moderate starch diet should be fed (22 to 27% of diet DM) in combination with a moderate to high soluble fiber content (6.0 to 8.5% of diet DM).","author":[{"family":"Ondarza","given":"M.

  {"id":"DePassille2011","abstract":"Dairy calves are increasingly fed large volumes of milk, which reduces feeding motivation and improves weight gain. However, calves often show signs of hunger and lose weight when weaned off milk due to low starter intake. We examined whether delaying the age at weaning would reduce responses to weaning. Calves were raised in groups of 9 and fed milk, starter, hay, and water with automated feeders. In each group, 3 calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: (1) low-milk, early-weaned: fed 6 L/d of milk and weaned at 47 d of age; (2) high-milk early-weaned: fed 12 L/d of milk and weaned at 47 d; (3) high-milk later-weaned: fed 12 L/d of milk and weaned at 89 d of age. Milk, starter, and hay intakes were recorded daily and digestible energy (DE) intake estimated. Feeder visits were recorded. Before weaning, the high-milk calves drank more milk, ate less starter and hay, but had higher DE intakes, gained more weight, and made fewer visits to the milk feeder than the low-milk, early-weaned calves. During and immediately after weaning, the high-fed, early-weaned calves ate less starter and hay, had lower DE intakes, and gained less weight than the low-milk, early-weaned calves and lost their body weight advantage 7 d after weaning. During and immediately after weaning, the high-milk, later-weaned calves ate more starter and hay and had higher DE intakes, higher weight gains, and made fewer visits to the milk feeder than the high-milk, early-weaned calves. They were still heavier than the low-milk, early-weaned calves 18 d after weaning.

The objective of this investigation was to evaluate whether there are alterations in several selected serum variables related to innate immunity and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism that precede occurrence of RP in transition Holstein dairy cows. METHODS One hundred multiparous Holstein dairy cows were involved in the study. Blood samples were collected from the coccygeal vein during the -8 to +4 wks around parturition, once per week before the morning feeding. Six healthy control cows (CON) and 6 cows with RP were selected and serum samples at -8, -4, time of diagnosis of disease, and +4 wks relative to parturition were used for analyses. All samples were analyzed for lactate, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), haptoglobin (Hp), and serum amyloid A (SAA). RESULTS Cows with RP had greater concentrations of serum lactate, IL-1, IL-6, TNF, and SAA in comparison with CON cows. Intriguingly, elevated concentrations of all five variables were observed at -8 and -4 wks before the occurrence of RP compared to healthy cows. Cows with RP also had lower DMI and milk production vs CON animals; however milk composition was not affected by RP. CONCLUSIONS Cows with RP showed an activated innate immunity 8 wks prior to diagnosis of disease. Overall results suggest that serum IL-1, IL- 6, and TNF, and lactate can be used as screening biomarkers to indicate cows that might have health issues during the transition period.","author":[{"family":"Dervishi","given":"Elda"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Guanshi"},{"family":"Hailemariam","given":"Dagnachew"},{"family":"Dunn","given":"Suzana M."},{"family":"Ametaj","given":"Burim N."}],"citation-key":"Dervishi2016","container-title":"Journal of Animal Science and Biotechnology","DOI":"10.1186/s40104-016-0085-9","ISBN":"4010401600859","ISSN":"20491891","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"1-13","PMID":"27119014","publisher":"Journal of Animal Science and Biotechnology","title":"Occurrence of retained placenta is preceded by an inflammatory state and alterations of energy metabolism in transition dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40104-016-0085-9","volume":"7"},

Twenty-four primiparous and multiparous Holstein cows were assigned based on parity and production level to replicated 4×4 Latin squares balanced for carryover effects with 21-d periods. Treatments were a control diet (no added PA), or 2.0% PA added as a small prill size (PA-SM; 284±12.4µm), a medium prill size (PA-MD; 325±14.7µm), or a large prill size (PA-LG; 600±17.4µm) supplement. Overall, PA treatments increased milk fat content (4.25 vs. 3.99%), milk fat yield (1.48 vs. 1.39kg/d), 3.5% fat-corrected milk (39.2 vs. 37.7kg/d), and improved feed efficiency (fat-corrected milk:dry matter intake; 1.51 vs. 1.42) compared with control. Compared with control, PA treatments did not affect dry matter intake, body weight, body condition score, or yields of milk, protein, and lactose. The PA treatments increased neutral detergent fiber digestibility (44.8 vs. 42.4%) and reduced the digestibility of 16-carbon fatty acids (72.3 vs. 79.1%) and total fatty acids (76.6 vs. 80.3%). Compared with control, PA treatments reduced the contents of de novo synthesized milk fatty acids (23.0 vs. 25.8g/100g of fatty acids) and preformed milk fatty acids (36.3 vs. 39.1g/100g of fatty acids), but did not affect their yields. In contrast, PA treatments increased the content (40.8 vs. 35.1g/100g of fatty acids) and yield (570 vs. 436g/d) of 16-carbon milk fatty acids compared with control. The PA prill size had no effect on dry matter intake, yield of milk and milk components, or feed efficiency. However, PA-LG tended to increase milk fat content compared with PA-SM (4.28 vs. 4.22%), and it increased 16-carbon fatty acid digestibility compared with PA-MD (74.2 vs. 71.0%) and PA-SM (74.2 vs. 71.7%). Additionally, PA-LG increased total fatty acid digestibility compared with PA-MD (78.1 vs. 75.6%) and PA-SM (78.1 vs. 76.0%).

Within each plot a 4 × 4 Latin square arrangement of treatments was used in 4 consecutive 21-d periods. Treatments were (1) control (CON; no supplemental fat), (2) high C16:0 supplement [PA; fatty acid (FA) supplement blend provided ∼80% C16:0], (3) C16:0 and C18:0 supplement (PA+SA; FA supplement blend provided ∼40% C16:0 + ∼40% C18:0), and (4) C16:0 and cis-9 C18:1 supplement (PA+OA; FA supplement blend provided ∼45% C16:0 + ∼35% cis-9 C18:1). Interactions between basal diets and FA treatments were observed for dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield. Among the SH diets, PA and PA+SA increased DMI compared with CON and PA+OA treatments, whereas in the CS diets PA+OA decreased DMI compared with CON. The PA, PA+SA, and PA+OA treatments increased milk yield compared with CON in the SH diets. The CS diets increased milk fat yield compared with the SH diets due to the greater yield of de novo and preformed milk FA. The PA treatment increased milk fat yield compared with CON, PA+SA, and PA+OA due to the greater yield of mixed-source (16-carbon) milk FA. The PA treatment increased 3.5% fat-corrected milk compared with CON and tended to increase it compared with PA+SA and PA+OA. The CS diets increased body weight (BW) change compared with the SH diets. Additionally, PA+OA tended to increase BW change compared with CON and PA and increased it in comparison with PA+SA. The PA and PA+OA treatments increased dry matter and neutral detergent fiber digestibility compared with PA+SA and tended to increase them compared with CON. The PA+SA treatment reduced 16-carbon, 18-carbon, and total FA digestibility compared with the other treatments. The CS diets increased energy partitioning toward body reserves compared with the SH diets. The PA treatment increased energy partitioning toward milk compared with CON and PA+OA and tended to increase it compared with PA+SA. In contrast, PA+OA increased energy partitioned to body reserves compared with PA and PA+SA and tended to increase it compared with CON. In conclusion, milk yield responses to different combinations of FA were affected by the addition of whole cottonseed in the diet. Among the combinations of C16:0, C18:0, and cis-9 C18:1 evaluated, fat supplements with more C16:0 increased energy output in milk, whereas fat supplements with more cis-9 C18:1 increased energy storage in BW. The combination of C16:0 and C18:0 reduced nutrient digestibility, which most likely explains the lower performance observed compared with other treatments.","author":[{"family":"Souza","given":"J.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Preseault","given":"C.L."},{"family":"Lock","given":"A.L."}],"citation-key":"DeSouza2018a","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2017-13460","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"172-185","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Altering the ratio of dietary palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids in diets with or without whole cottonseed affects nutrient digestibility, energy partitioning, and production responses of dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030217310081","volume":"101"},

Forty mid-lactation Holstein cows (18 primiparous and 22 multiparous) were used in a block design. Cows were assigned to receive either a control diet containing no supplemental fat (CON) or a C16:0-enriched supplemented diet (PA; 1.5% diet dry matter) fed for 10 wk. Compared with CON, PA increased dry matter intake, milk yield, cumulative milk yield, milk fat content, milk fat yield, 16-carbon milk fatty acid (FA) yield, 3.5% fat-corrected milk yield, and energy-corrected milk yield. Additionally, PA increased body weight change, but did not affect body condition score change compared with CON. A tendency for a treatment by parity interaction was observed for milk yield due to PA increasing milk yield in multiparous but not in primiparous cows. In addition, we observed interactions between treatment and parity for fat-corrected milk, energy-corrected milk, and milk fat yield due to PA increasing these variables to a greater extent in multiparous compared with primiparous cows. Interestingly, we observed an interaction between treatment and parity for body weight change, due to PA increasing body weight change in primiparous but not in multiparous cows. The PA treatment increased dry matter and neutral detergent fiber digestibilities compared with CON. Although PA did not affect 18-carbon FA digestibility, compared with CON, PA decreased 16-carbon and total FA digestibilities and increased total FA intake by 470 g/d and absorbed total FA by 316 g/d. We also observed an interaction between treatment and parity for total absorbed FA due to PA increasing it to a greater extent in multiparous than in primiparous cows. Compared with CON, PA increased apparent energy intake and milk energy output. We observed an interaction between treatment and parity for milk energy output due to PA increasing milk energy output to a greater extent in multiparous than primiparous cows. Additionally, an interaction between treatment and parity was observed for energy output in body reserves due to PA increasing energy output in body reserves in primiparous but not in multiparous cows. In conclusion, production responses of dairy cows to PA were consistent throughout the 10-wk treatment period.

Fifty-two multiparous cows were used in a randomized complete block design experiment. During the fresh (FR) period (1–24 d in milk) cows were assigned to either a control diet containing no supplemental fat (CON) or a C16:0-supplemented diet [PA; 1.5% of diet dry matter (DM)]. During the peak (PK) period (25–67 d in milk) cows were assigned to either a CON diet or a PA diet (1.5% of diet DM) in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments considering the diet that they received during the FR period. During the FR period, compared with CON, PA increased DM digestibility by 3.0 percentage units and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility by 4.4 percentage units, and the increase in these variables was consistent over time. Although PA did not affect 18-carbon fatty acid (FA) digestibility, it decreased 16-carbon FA digestibility by 10.8 percentage units and total FA digestibility by 4.7 percentage units compared with CON. We observed a tendency for an interaction between treatment and time for total FA digestibility and 16-carbon FA digestibility due to the difference in FA digestibility between PA and CON reducing over time. Compared with CON, PA increased digestible energy intake by 3.9 Mcal/d, metabolizable energy intake by 3.5 Mcal/d, and net energy for lactation intake by 2.5 Mcal/d. The PA diet also increased milk energy output, negative energy balance, and plasma nonesterified fatty acid concentration and reduced plasma insulin concentration. We also observed a tendency for an interaction between treatment and time for energy balance due to cows receiving the PA treatment being in a greater negative energy balance over time. During the PK period, PA increased DM digestibility by 2.9 percentage units and NDF digestibility by 3.5 percentage units compared with CON. Although PA decreased 16-carbon FA digestibility by 7.0 percentage units, PA did not affect 18-carbon FA digestibility or total FA digestibility. Feeding PA during the PK period increased energy intake and milk energy output and did not affect energy balance. In conclusion, feeding a C16:0 supplement to early-lactation cows consistently increased DM and NDF digestibilities and energy intake compared with a control diet containing no supplemental fat.

Fifty-two multiparous cows were used in a randomized complete block design experiment. During the fresh period (FR; 1–24 d in milk) cows were assigned to either a control diet containing no supplemental fat (CON) or a diet supplemented with C16:0 (palmitic acid, PA; 1.5% of diet dry matter). During the peak (PK) period (25–67 d in milk) cows were assigned to either a CON diet or a PA (1.5% of diet dry matter) diet in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments considering the diet that they received during the FR period. During the FR period, we did not observe treatment differences for dry matter intake or milk yield. Compared with CON, PA increased the yield of 3.5% fat-corrected milk by 5.30 kg/d, yield of energy-corrected milk (ECM) by 4.70 kg/d, milk fat content by 0.41% units, milk fat yield by 280 g/d, and protein yield by 100 g/d. The increase in milk fat associated with the PA treatment during the FR period occurred due to an increase in yield of 16-carbon milk fatty acids (FA) by 147 g/d (derived from both de novo synthesis and extraction from plasma) and preformed milk FA by 96 g/d. Compared with CON, PA decreased body weight (BW) by 21 kg and body condition score (BCS) by 0.09 units and tended to increase BW loss by 0.76 kg/d. Although PA consistently increased milk fat yield and ECM over time, a treatment × time interaction was observed for BW and BCS due to PA inducing a greater decrease in BW and BCS after the second week of treatments. Feeding PA during the PK period increased milk yield by 3.45 kg/d, yield of 3.5% fat-corrected milk by 4.50 kg/d, yield of ECM by 4.60 kg/d, milk fat content by 0.22% units, milk fat yield by 210 g/d, protein yield by 140 g/d, and lactose yield by 100 g/d but tended to reduce BW by 10 kg compared with CON. Also, during the PK period we observed an interaction between diet fed in the FR and PK periods for milk fat yield due to feeding PA during the PK period increasing milk fat yield to a greater extent in cows that received the CON diet (+240 g/d) rather than the PA diet (+180 g/d) during the FR period. This difference was associated with the yield of preformed FA because feeding PA during the PK period increased the yield of preformed milk FA only in cows that received the CON diet during the FR period. In conclusion, feeding a C16:0 supplement to early-lactation cows consistently increased the yield of ECM in both the FR and PK periods compared with a control diet. For some variables, the effect of feeding C16:0 was affected by timing of supplementation because milk yield increased only during the PK period and BW decreased to a greater extent in the FR period. Regardless of diet fed in the FR period, feeding a C16:0 supplement during the PK period increased yields of milk and milk components.","author":[{"family":"Souza","given":"J.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Lock","given":"A.L."}],"citation-key":"DeSouza2018d","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2018-14976","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"260-273","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Effects of timing of palmitic acid supplementation on production responses of early-lactation dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-14976","volume":"102"},

  {"id":"DeVries2005","abstract":"The objective of this experiment was to determine whether it is the return from milking or delivery of fresh feed that has the greater effect on the daily patterns of feeding and lying behavior of dairy cattle. Forty-eight lactating Holstein cows were subjected to each of 2 treatments in a 2 x 2 cross-over design replicated over time. The treatments were 1) milking and feed delivery times coinciding and 2) feed delivery 6 h after milking. Cows were milked twice daily at 0500 and 1700 h. An electronic monitoring system was used to measure the time spent at the feed alley. Time-lapse video was used to quantify the lying time and incidence of aggressive displacements of the cows at the feed alley. Cows increased their total daily feeding time by 12.5% when fed 6 h after milking. This change was driven by an 82% increase in feeding time during the first hour immediately following the delivery of fresh feed and a 26% decrease in feeding time during the first hour after milking. The delivery of feed 6 h after milking did not change the daily lying time of the cows, but did decrease the latency to lie down after milking by 20 min. The reduction in feeding time after milking and decreased latency to lie down resulted in a tendency for less aggressive interactions at the feed alley after the cows returned from milking. These results indicate that the delivery of fresh feed has a greater impact on stimulating feeding behavior than does the return from milking and that changes in feeding management can affect both the feeding and lying behavior of dairy cows.","author":[{"family":"DeVries","given":"T.J."},{"family":"Keyserlingk","given":"M.A.G.","non-dropping-particle":"von"}],"citation-key":"DeVries2005","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)72726-0","ISBN":"0022-0302, 0022-0302","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"page":"625-631","PMID":"15653529","title":"Time of Feed Delivery Affects the Feeding and Lying Patterns of Dairy Cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030205727260","volume":"88"},
  {"id":"DeVries2012","abstract":"This study was designed to determine the effect of adding a molasses-based liquid feed (LF) supplement to a total mixed ration (TMR) on the feed sorting behavior and production of dairy cows. Twelve lactating Holstein cows (88.2±19.5 DIM) were exposed, in a crossover design with 21-d periods, to each of 2 treatment diets: 1) control TMR and 2) control TMR with 4.1% dietary dry matter LF added. Dry matter intake (DMI), sorting, and milk yield were recorded for the last 7 d of each treatment period. Milk samples were collected for composition analysis for the last 3 d of each treatment period; these data were used to calculate 4% fat-corrected milk and energy-corrected milk yield. Sorting was determined by subjecting fresh feed and orts samples to particle separation and expressing the actual intake of each particle fraction as a percentage of the predicted intake of that fraction. Addition of LF did not noticeably change the nutrient composition of the ration, with the exception of an expected increase in dietary sugar concentration (from 4.0 to 5.4%). Liquid feed supplementation affected the particle size distribution of the ration, resulting in a lesser amount of short and a greater amount of fine particles. Cows sorted against the longest ration particles on both treatment diets; the extent of this sorting was greater on the control diet (55.0 vs. 68.8%). Dry matter intake was 1.4 kg/d higher when cows were fed the LF diet as compared with the control diet, resulting in higher acid-detergent fiber, neutral-detergent fiber, and sugar intakes. As a result of the increased DMI, cows tended to produce 1.9 kg/d more milk and produced 3.1 and 3.2 kg/d more 4% fat-corrected milk and energy-corrected milk, respectively, on the LF diet. As a result, cows tended to produce more milk fat (0.13 kg/d) and produced more milk protein (0.09 kg/d) on the LF diet. No difference between treatments was observed in the efficiency of milk production. Overall, adding a molasses-based LF to TMR can be used to decrease feed sorting, enhance DMI, and improve milk yield.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"DeVries","given":"T J"},{"family":"Gill","given":"R M"}],"citation-key":"DeVries2012","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2011-4965","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",5]]},"page":"2648-55","PMID":"22541492","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Adding liquid feed to a total mixed ration reduces feed sorting behavior and improves productivity of lactating dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22541492","volume":"95"},

  {"id":"Dewhurst2009","abstract":"Legume forages have an important position in ruminant production in Western Europe and with further development can play an even larger role. Red clover for silage and white clover in grazed swards lead to enhanced growth rate and milk yield in comparison with pure grasses. Much of the production benefit of these legumes relates to enhanced intake since digestibilities are not markedly different to grasses. The higher intake of legume silages reflects differences in the cell structure of legume plants which combined with high fermentation rates means that they break down into small particles in the rumen, and leave the rumen more rapidly than perennial ryegrass. Ease of ingestion leads to high rates of intake, which explains higher intakes for grazed legumes. A further benefit of legumes is the reduced rate of decline in digestibility with advancing maturity. Whilst legumes have limited effects on gross milk composition or carcass characteristics, there are marked increases in levels of beneficial n-3 PUFA. Legumes have often led to a reduction in methane production from the rumen and again, this relates to both physical and chemical differences between forage species. The high rates of release of soluble protein and of breakdown to small particles from clovers and lucerne is associated with susceptibility to bloat, which is a limitation to further exploitation in grazing systems. The high concentration of rapidly degraded protein in legumes also leads to inefficient utilisation of dietary N and increased urinary N output. Research with tanniniferous forages, such as birdsfoot trefoil and sulla, demonstrates the potential for future legumes with reduced environmental and health effects, though these particular forage legumes are not well adapted to temperate regions of Western Europe that are the focus of this review.","author":[{"family":"Dewhurst","given":"R.

  {"id":"diasjunior2016","abstract":"Kernel processing increases starch digestibility in whole-plant corn silage (WPCS). Corn silage processing score (CSPS), the percentage of starch passing through a 4.75-mm sieve, is widely used to assess degree of kernel breakage in WPCS. However, the geometric mean particle size (GMPS) of the kernel-fraction that passes through the 4.75-mm sieve has not been well described. Therefore, the objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate particle size distribution and digestibility of kernels cut in varied particle sizes; (2) to propose a method to measure GMPS in WPCS kernels; and (3) to evaluate the relationship between CSPS and GMPS of the kernel fraction in WPCS. Composite samples of unfermented, dried kernels from 110 corn hybrids commonly used for silage production were kept whole (WH) or manually cut in 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64 pieces (2P, 4P, 8P, 16P, 32P, and 64P, respectively). Dry sieving to determine GMPS, surface area, and particle size distribution using 9 sieves with nominal square apertures of 9.50, 6.70, 4.75, 3.35, 2.36, 1.70, 1.18, and 0.59mm and pan, as well as ruminal in situ dry matter (DM) digestibilities were performed for each kernel particle number treatment. Incubation times were 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. The ruminal in situ DM disappearance of unfermented kernels increased with the reduction in particle size of corn kernels. Kernels kept whole had the lowest ruminal DM disappearance for all time points with maximum DM disappearance of 6.9% at 24 h and the greatest disappearance was observed for 64P, followed by 32P and 16P. Samples of WPCS (n=80) from 3 studies representing varied theoretical length of cut settings and processor types and settings were also evaluated. Each WPCS sample was divided in 2 and then dried at 60°C for 48 h. The CSPS was determined in duplicate on 1 of the split samples, whereas on the other split sample the kernel and stover fractions were separated using a hydrodynamic separation procedure. After separation, the kernel fraction was redried at 60°C for 48 h in a forced-air oven and dry sieved to determine GMPS and surface area. Linear relationships between CSPS from WPCS (n=80) and kernel fraction GMPS, surface area, and proportion passing through the 4.75-mm screen were poor. Strong quadratic relationships between proportion of kernel fraction passing through the 4.75-mm screen and kernel fraction GMPS and surface area were observed. These findings suggest that hydrodynamic separation and dry sieving of the kernel fraction may provide a better assessment of kernel breakage in WPCS than CSPS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Dias Junior","given":"G.

Minimal literature exists to describe agreement between automated and static scales, and no known studies describe repeatability when used for daily measurements of dairy cows. This study establishes the repeatability of an automated walk-over cattle-weighing system, and agreement with static electronic scales, when used in a commercial dairy herd to weigh lactating cows. Forty-six lactating dairy cows from a seasonal calving, pasture-based dairy herd in southwest Victoria, Australia, were weighed once using a set of static scales and repeatedly using an automated walk-over weighing system at the exit of a rotary dairy. Substantial agreement was observed between the automated and static scales when assessed using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. Weights measured by the automated walkover scales were within 5% of those measured by the static scales in 96% of weighings. Bland and Altman's 95% limits of agreement were -23.3 to 43.6 kg, a range of 66.9 kg. The 95% repeatability coefficient for automated weighings was 46.3 kg. Removal of a single outlier from the data set increased Lin's concordance coefficient, narrowed Bland and Altman's 95% limits of agreement to a range of 32.5 kg, and reduced the 95% repeatability coefficient to 18.7 kg. Cow misbehavior during walk-over weighing accounted for many of the larger weight discrepancies. The automated walk-over weighing system showed substantial agreement with the static scales when assessed using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient. This contrasted with limited agreement when assessed using Bland and Altman's method, largely due to poor repeatability. This suggests the automated weighing system is inadequate for detecting small liveweight differences in individual cows based on comparisons of single weights. Misbehaviors and other factors can result in the recording of spurious values on walk-over scales. Excluding outlier weights and comparing means of 7 consecutive daily weights may improve agreement sufficiently to allow meaningful assessment of small short-term changes in automated weights in individuals and groups of cows.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Dickinson","given":"R","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Morton","given":"J M"},{"family":"Beggs","given":"D S"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"G","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Pyman","given":"M F"},{"family":"Mansell","given":"P D"},{"family":"Blackwood","given":"C B"}],"citation-key":"Dickinson2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-6522","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",7]]},"page":"4477-86","PMID":"23684033","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"An automated walk-over weighing system as a tool for measuring liveweight change in lactating dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23684033","volume":"96"},

  {"id":"Dirandeh2013","abstract":"In spite of the difficulties in delivering PUFA to ruminants, studies have generally indicated that the PUFA of the omega-6 (linoleic acid) and omega-3 [α-linolenic acid; eicosapentaenoic (EPA), C20:5 omega-3; docosahexaenoic (DHA), C22:6 omega-3] families are the most beneficial to improving reproduction in cows. The objectives were to determine if a diet enriched in α-linolenic acid (omega-3) or linoleic acid (omega-6) would influence milk production and composition, metabolic status, and reproductive performance in lactating dairy cows. High-yielding multiparous Holstein dairy cows (n = 120) with no overt clinical illnesses were blocked according to calving date and parity. Cows were assigned randomly to be fed 1) soybean whole roast (Soy, omega-6, n = 40) or 2) linseed (Lin, omega-3, n = 40) or 3) palm oil as a source of SFA (PO, n = 40) from calving until first heat after 40 d postpartum (dpp), and then half of the cows in each treatment group were switched to receive either Lin or SFA (PO) from first heat after d 40 to 120 dpp. Blood was collected from a subsample of cows. Blood was collected at 14 d intervals for 12 wk, starting on the day of calving. Results showed milk yield and DMI were not affected. Milk compositions were similar (P > 0.08) among diets, except concentration and yield of milk fat percentage, which was less in cows fed Lin (P < 0.05). Uterine involution in cows fed Soy occurred earlier (P < 0.05). Diets affected day to first estrus and day to first insemination in cows (P < 0.05). There were no differences among treatments for percent heat detection, percent pregnancy per first insemination, and percent conception per AI at estrus. Also, there is a trend of pregnancy by 120 d, which is 66.7% for the Lin group vs. 50.91% for the PO group (P < 0.08). Of the 4 pregnancy losses, 2 occurred in PO-PO group and 2 occurred in Soy-PO group, and none occurred in the other 4 treatments. In conclusion, our study showed feeding omega-6 fatty acids during 40 dpp could be a good treatment for early postpartum periods, and a shift to omega-3 fatty acids until 40 d after AI can be considered as a strategy for improving fertility in lactating dairy cows © 2013 American Society of Animal Science.","author":[{"family":"Dirandeh","given":"E."},{"family":"Towhidi","given":"A."},{"family":"Zeinoaldini","given":"S."},{"family":"Ganjkhanlou","given":"M."},{"family":"Pirsaraei","given":"Z.

  {"id":"dobicki2006","abstract":"The aim of present investigations was to determine the effect of dried yeasts and a preparation isolated from cell membranes of beer yeasts (MOS) on the yield and composition of milk from Polish Holstein-Friesian cows during the first 100 days of lactation (variety Red-and-White), fed according to the PMR system. The development of the rumen microflora was also taken into consideration. The experiment was conducted on 75 Polish Holstein-Friesian cows maintained in tied stalls. The cows calved during the summer season. The experimental design included two experimental and one control group (Table 1). The number of protozoa and bacteria were determined in the rumen fluid of 8 cows selected at random from each group at the end of the experiment (24 animals in total). The addition of dried beer yeast preparations (dried yeasts – 80 g per head per day and extract of yeast cell membranes – 20 g MOS) to the feed of high-producing dairy cows resulted in a statistically significant increase in milk yield in comparison to animals of the control group, (by 3 and 2.2 kg milk per day). A significant (by 34-39%) increase was observed in the number of bacteria in the rumen fluid, what indicates that the feed additives used lead to a more efficient utilisation of fibre from the daily ration, improved the energy balance and the use of nutrients for milk production with a simultaneous decrease of the Somatic Cell Count (SCC). These results confirm that the yeast preparations offered positively stimulated the immunological system.","author":[{"family":"Dobicki","given":"A."},{"family":"Pres","given":"J."},{"family":"Zachwieja","given":"A."},{"family":"Kwasnicki","given":"R."}],"citation-key":"dobicki2006","container-title":"ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF POLISH AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITIES","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"page":"1-10","title":"SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE PREPARATIONS IN THE FEEDING OF COWS AND THEIR EFFECT ON MILK YIELD AND COMPOSITION AS WELL AS RUMEN MICROORGANISMS","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"dong2017","abstract":"Objective\nTo assess the potency of calcium propionate (CAP) used as silage additive, an experiment was carried out to evaluate the effect of CAP on the nitrogen transformation, fermentation quality and aerobic stability of alfalfa silages.\n\nMethods\nAlfalfa was ensiled with four levels of CAP (5, 10, 15, and 20 g/kg of fresh weight [FW]) in laboratory silos for 30 days. After opening, the silages were analyzed for the chemical and microbiological characteristics, and subjected to an aerobic stability test.\n\nResults\nThe increasing proportion of CAP did not affect pH, lactic acid (LA) concentrations and yeast counts, while linearly decreased counts of enterobacteria (p = 0.029), molds (p<0.001) and clostridia (p<0.001), and concentrations of acetic acid (p<0.001), propionic acid (p<0.001), butyric acid (p<0.001), and ethanol (p = 0.007), and quadratically (p = 0.001) increased lactic acid bacteria counts. With increasing the proportion of CAP, the dry matter (DM) loss (p<0.001), free amino acid N (p<0.001), ammonia N (p = 0.004), and non-protein N (p<0.001) contents were linearly reduced, whereas DM (p = 0.048), water soluble carbohydrate (p<0.001) and peptide N (p<0.001) contents were linearly increased. The highest Flieg’s point was found in CAP10 (75.9), represented the best fermentation quality. All silages treated with CAP improved aerobic stability as indicated by increased stable hours compared with control.\n\nConclusion\nThe addition of CAP can suppress the undesirable microorganisms during ensiling and exposure to air, thereby improving the fermentation quality and aerobic stability as well as retarding the proteolysis of alfalfa silage. It is suggested that CAP used as an additive is recommended at a level of 10 g/kg FW.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Dong","given":"Zhihao"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Xianjun"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Aiyou"},{"family":"Desta","given":"Seare T."},{"family":"Shao","given":"Tao"}],"citation-key":"dong2017","container-title":"Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences","container-title-short":"Asian-Australas J Anim Sci","DOI":"10.5713/ajas.16.0956","ISSN":"1011-2367","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9]]},"page":"1278-1284","PMCID":"PMC5582284","PMID":"28423881","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Effects of calcium propionate on the fermentation quality and aerobic stability of alfalfa silage","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5582284/","volume":"30"},

It is shown that, assuming no interference, all the crossover processes in the pedigree may be viewed jointly as a continuous-time Markov random walk on the vertices of a hypercube, the time parameter being map distance along the chromosome. The event that two individuals have a segment of chromosome in common, thus proving them to be related, corresponds to the random walk hitting a particular set of vertices. The probability of this happening is calculated for various types of relationship, making use of the symmetry of the situation to partition the vertices into a very much smaller number of orbits and render the computation manageable. The probability that an individual with n children passes on all his or her genes to them is also calculated in this way.","author":[{"family":"Donnelly","given":"K P"}],"citation-key":"Donnelly1983","container-title":"Theoretical population biology","ISSN":"0040-5809","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1983",2]]},"page":"34-63","PMID":"6857549","title":"The probability that related individuals share some section of genome identical by descent.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6857549","volume":"23"},

Whole diet total tract apparent digestibility, dry matter (DM) intake, milk production, milk composition, ruminal fermentation characteristics and milk fatty acid profile were determined. At the beginning of the experiment, cows were 556 ± 39.8. kg of body weight and 100 ± 62.6. d in milk. There was no interaction between pelleting and lignosulfonate for any parameter studied. Lignosulfonate and pelleting had no effect on DM intake (i.e., concentrate. +. pasture) and lignosulfonate had no effect on nutrient intakes (i.e., concentrate. +. pasture). Intake (i.e., concentrate. +. pasture) of ether extract was lower for cows fed pelleted than for those fed non-pelleted concentrates, but there was no difference among treatments in total intake of other nutrients. Pelleting had no effect on digestibility, but decreased milk fat concentration. Milk production, milk concentrations of crude protein, lactose and total solids, and milk yields of crude protein and fat were similar among treatments. Pelleting had more effects than lignosulfonate treatment on milk fatty acid profiles, with concentrations of trans11-18:1 and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) being, respectively, 178% and 200% of those found in milk fat of cows fed non-pelleted concentrates.

Eighteen nonpregnant, nonlactating cows (BCS=3.04±0.25) were blocked based on initial BCS and were randomly assigned within each block to 2 treatments. Treatments were either high energy [HE; net energy for lactation (NEL)=1.62 Mcal/kg] or low energy (LE; NEL=1.35 Mcal/kg) diets fed as total mixed rations for 8 wk. The LE diet consisted of 81.7% forage, including 40.5% wheat straw and 28.3% corn silage, whereas the HE diet contained 73.8% forage with no straw and 49.9% corn silage (dry matter basis). Cows were fed for ad libitum intake once daily at 0800h. Feed intake was recorded daily, blood was sampled at wk 1, 4, and 7, and BCS was assigned at wk 1, 4, and 7. Cows were killed following the 8-wk period, and visceral organs, mammary gland, and internal adipose tissues were weighed and sampled. The HE group had greater dry matter intake (15.9 vs. 11.2±0.5 kg/d) and energy intakes than cows fed LE, but neutral detergent fiber intake did not differ (5.8 vs. 5.6±0.25 kg/d for HE and LE). Final body weight was greater for cows fed HE (807 vs. 750kg), but BCS did not differ between groups (3.52 vs. 3.47 for HE and LE).

Although subcutaneous adipose mass was not measured, carcass weight (including hide and subcutaneous fat) did not differ between HE (511kg) and LE (496kg). Liver weight tended to be greater for cows fed HE, but weights of gastrointestinal tract, heart, and kidney did not differ. Serum insulin tended to be greater and the glucose to insulin ratio was lower for cows fed HE. Serum concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate and cholesterol were greater for HE cows than for LE cows but concentrations of glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, total protein, and albumin did not differ. Final BCS was correlated with masses of omental (r=0.57), mesenteric (r=0.59), and perirenal (r=0.72) adipose tissue, but mesenteric adipose mass increased more as BCS increased for cows fed HE.

The system consisted of pressure-sensitive radio frequency transmitters affixed over the sacrum region of cows. The activation of the sensor sent a radiotelemetric signal to a microcomputer via a fixed antenna. Cow identification, date, time, and duration of each standing event were recorded in the software program provided with the system. Each farm selected a 3-h interval to AI for cows that were identified in estrus during the previous 24 h. Pregnancy status was determined from data for return to estrus and palpation of the uterus 35 to 75 d following AI. Standing events during estrus averaged (+/- SD) 8.5 +/- 6.6 per cow, and the number of events per estrus across herds averaged from 6.2 +/- 5.1 to 12.8 +/- 9.9 per cow. The duration of estrus ranged from 5.1 +/- 3.8 to 10.6 +/- 6.8 h across herds; the mean was 7.1 +/- 5.4 h. The interval from the first standing event to AI affected the probability of pregnancy; the highest conception rates for AI occurred between 4 and 12 h after the onset of standing activity. The probability of pregnancy was higher for cows > 100 d in milk, exhibiting > 2 standing events during estrus, and inseminated during March, April or May.","author":[{"family":"Dransfield","given":"M B"},{"family":"Nebel","given":"R L"},{"family":"Pearson","given":"R E"},{"family":"Warnick","given":"L D"}],"citation-key":"Dransfield1998","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(98)75758-3","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",7]]},"page":"1874-82","PMID":"9710754","title":"Timing of insemination for dairy cows identified in estrus by a radiotelemetric estrus detection system.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9710754","volume":"81"},
  {"id":"Dreihuis1999","abstract":"Aerobic deterioration of silages is initiated by (facultative) aerobic micro-organisms, usually yeasts, that oxidize the preserving organic acids. In this study, a Lactobacillus buchneri strain isolated from maize silage was evaluated for its potential as a bacterial inoculant that enhances aerobic stability of silages. In four experiments, chopped whole crop maize (30–43% dry matter (DM)) was inoculated with Lact. buchneri and ensiled in laboratory silos. Uninoculated silages served as controls. Analysis of silages treated with Lact. buchneri at levels of 103–106 cfu g−1 after about 3 months of anaerobic storage showed that acetic acid and 1-propanol contents increased with inoculum levels above 104 cfu g−1, whereas lactic acid decreased. Propionic acid, silage pH and DM loss increased with inoculum levels above 105 cfu g−1. Time course experiments with maize inoculated with Lact. buchneri at 4×104–2×105 cfu g−1 showed that up to 7–14 d after ensiling, Lact. buchneri had no effect on silage characteristics. Thereafter, the lactic acid content of the inoculated silages declined and, simultaneously, acetic acid and, to a lesser extent, propionic acid and 1-propanol, accumulated. Inoculation reduced survival of yeasts during the anaerobic storage phase and inhibited yeast growth when the silage was exposed to O2, resulting in a substantial improvement in aerobic stability. The results indicate that the use of Lact. buchneri as a silage inoculant can enhance aerobic stability by inhibition of yeasts. The ability of the organism to ferment lactic acid to acetic acid appears to be an important underlying principle of this effect.

  {"id":"Driehuis2018","abstract":"Silage may contain several agents that are potentially hazardous to animal health, the safety of milk or other animal food products, or both. This paper reviews published literature about microbial hazards, plant toxins, and chemical hazards. Microbial hazards include Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium bovis, and various mold species. High concentrations of C. botulinum in silage have been associated with cattle botulism. A high initial concentration of C. botulinum spores in forage in combination with poor silage fermentation conditions can promote the growth of C. botulinum in silage. The elevated pH level that is generally associated with aerobic deterioration of silage is a major factor influencing concentrations of L. monocytogenes, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, and molds in silage and may also encourage survival and growth of M. bovis, the bacterium that causes bovine tuberculosis. Soil is a major source of B. cereus spores in silage; growth of this bacterium in silage appears to be limited. Hazards from plant toxins include pyrrolizidine, tropane and tropolone alkaloids, phytoestrogens, prussic acid, and mimosine, compounds that exist naturally in certain plant species that may contaminate forages at harvesting. Another group of toxins belonging to this category are ergot alkaloids, which are produced by endophytic fungal species in forages such as tall fescue grass, sorghum, and ryegrass. Varying effects of ensiling on the degradation of these plant toxins have been reported. Chemical hazards include nitrate, nitrite, and toxic oxide gases of nitrogen produced from nitrate and high levels of butyric acid, biogenic amines, and ammonia. Chemical and microbiological hazards are associated with poorly fermented silages, which can be avoided by using proper silage-making practices and creating conditions that promote a rapid and sufficient reduction of the silage pH and prevent aerobic deterioration.","author":[{"family":"Driehuis","given":"F."},{"family":"Wilkinson","given":"J.

  {"id":"dschaak2010","abstract":"A lactating dairy cow experiment was conducted to determine the influence of a ruminal buffer product containing magnesium-exchanged zeolite on ruminal fermentation and lactational performance. The experimental TMR diet consisted of 38% alfalfa hay, 19% corn silage, 14% corn grain, and 30% concentrate mix on a DM basis, and it was fed ad libitum. Thirty primiparous and multiparous lactating Holstein cows (52±23.0 DIM) were assigned to 1 of 3 dietary treatments with 10 cows in each treatment: control (TMR diet without ruminal buffer), TMR diet with 1.4% sodium bicarbonate (SBD), and TMR diet with 1.4% zeolite product (ZD). The experiment was a completely randomized design performed over 12 wk. Intake of DM was similar (26.5kg/d) across treatments. Milk yield was similar among the 3 treatments (40.7kg/d on average), and efficiency (4% FCM/DMI) was not affected by treatments. Milk fat concentration did not differ among treatments, whereas milk protein concentration tended to be higher for the ZD than for the control and the SBD (P=0.15). Although feeding the ZD resulted in a tendency of increased milk protein concentration, feed nitrogen (N) efficiency for milk N did not differ among the 3 treatments. In addition, milk urea N concentration was not influenced by feeding the ZD. Ruminal pH tended to increase (P=0.11) when feeding the SBD or the ZD compared with the control. Concentration of ammonia N did not differ among treatments. Feeding the ZD tended to decrease (P=0.14) total VFA production compared with feeding the control and the SBD, whereas molar proportions of acetate and propionate were not affected by the treatments. The zeolite product used in this study would cost-effectively replace sodium bicarbonate as a ruminal buffer additive in a lactating dairy diet, but its efficacy needs to be further assessed when supplemented in a high-concentrate lactating dairy diet whereby animals may experience subacute ruminal acidosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Dschaak","given":"C.

  {"id":"Dufour2011","abstract":"A systematic review of the scientific literature on relationships between management practices used on dairy farms and herd somatic cell count (SCC) was undertaken to distinguish those management practices that have been consistently shown to be associated with herd SCC from those lacking evidence of association. Relevant literature was identified using a combination of database searches (PubMed, Medline, CAB, Agricola, and Web of Science) and iterative screening of references. To be included in the review, a manuscript had to be published after 1979 in French, English, or Dutch; study design had to be other than case report or case series; herds studied had to be composed of >=40 milking cows producing on average >=7,000 kg of milk in 305 d; interventions studied had to be management practices applied at the herd level and used as udder health control strategies; and SCC had to be measured using electronic cell counting methods. The 36 manuscripts selected were mainly observational cross-sectional studies; 8 manuscripts dealt exclusively with automatic milking systems and 4 with management of calves and heifers and its effect on SCC in early lactation heifers. Most practices having consistent associations with SCC were related to milking procedures: wearing gloves during milking, using automatic take-offs, using postmilking teat dipping, milking problem cows last, yearly inspection of the milking system, and use of a technique to keep cows standing following milking; all were consistently associated with lower herd SCC. Other practices associated with lower SCC were the use of a freestall system, sand bedding, cleaning the calving pen after each calving, surveillance of dry-cow udders for mastitis, use of blanket dry-cow therapy, parenteral selenium supplementation, udder hair management, and frequent use of the California Mastitis Test. Regarding SCC of heifers, most of the consistent associations reported were related to interventions made during the peripartum period. Studies on automatic milking systems have frequently reported elevation of the herd SCC following transition to the new system. These elevations seemed to be mediated both by the lack of monitoring of chronically infected cows and by an elevated incidence of intramammary infections. By assembling the results reported in many different studies, this review generates a more comprehensive understanding of the management practices influencing SCC and highlights areas of SCC control knowledge that lack evidence of effectiveness.","author":[{"family":"Dufour","given":"S"},{"family":"Fréchette","given":"A"},{"family":"Barkema","given":"H W"},{"family":"Mussell","given":"A"},{"family":"Scholl","given":"D T"}],"citation-key":"Dufour2011","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"DOI: 10.3168/jds.2010-3715","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"page":"563-579","title":"Invited review: Effect of udder health management practices on herd somatic cell count","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B9887-520NK8X-5/2/a3af4628851944f812125fccdd556f00","volume":"94"},

  {"id":"Durel2017","abstract":"Neonatal calf diarrhoea can have important economic consequences. Scour vaccines are available against some of the most frequent pathogens responsible for this disease: Bovine Rotavirus (BoRV), Bovine Coronavirus (BoCV) and E. coli K99. In this multi-centre, randomised, blinded study, adult cows vaccinated with a trivalent vaccine marketed for years (Rotavec™ Corona, MSD Animal Health - RC) prior to last parturition were revaccinated 12–15 months later, prior to the upcoming parturition, with either a single injection of a recently marketed vaccine (Bovigen™ Scour, Virbac - BS), or RC. The aim of this trial was to verify whether BS is not inferior to RC for the stimulation of the immune response and the passive transfer to calves in these conditions. A total of 136 multiparous dairy cows, from 5 different herds and located in 3 countries (France, UK and Germany) were enrolled in the study. Sixty-five cows were vaccinated with BS and 71 with RC. Antibody levels, measured by competitive ELISA and represented as percentage of inhibition (PI), were assessed in the cow's serum (on the day of vaccination: D0 and on days 21, 42 and at calving), in the colostrum and in the serum of calves in the first week of life. Differences in means of PI between groups and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. The non-inferiority threshold was set at −10%. The relationships between antibody levels in the colostrum and the vaccination-calving interval (VCI) or the inter-booster vaccination interval (IBVI) were also analysed. All the lower margins of the 95% CI of the difference in means of PI, in all samples and for the 3 pathogens assessed, were above −10%. This result shows that BS is not inferior to RC for the stimulation of the immune response against BoRV, BoCV and E. coli K99 and the passive transfer of immunity to calves when this vaccine is administered to their dams previously vaccinated with RC. Furthermore, no correlation was found between PI values in the colostrum and the VCI or IBVI. The ratio of animals with a PI ≥ 95% in the colostrum, among cows with similar intervals, was not significantly different between groups, for all antigens tested. Therefore, this study shows that a single injection of the heterologous vaccine BS can be used as a booster in cattle previously vaccinated with RC.","author":[{"family":"Durel","given":"Luc"},{"family":"Rose","given":"Clancy"},{"family":"Bainbridge","given":"Tracy"},{"family":"Roubert","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Dressel","given":"Klaus Ulrich"},{"family":"Bennemann","given":"Johanna"},{"family":"Rückner","given":"Antje"},{"family":"Vahlenkamp","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Maillard","given":"Renaud"}],"citation-key":"Durel2017","container-title":"Livestock Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.livsci.2017.08.011","ISSN":"18711413","issue":"August","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"52-58","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","title":"Immune response of mature cows subjected to annual booster vaccination against neonatal calf diarrhoea with two different commercial vaccines: A non-inferiority study","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2017.08.011","volume":"204"},

  {"id":"Eastridge1991","abstract":"Effects of feeding hydrogenated tallow fatty acids and triglycerides to lactating dairy cows were studied using five primiparous Holstein cows in a 5 x 5 Latin square design. A control diet with no supplemental fat and diets containing either hydrogenated tallow fatty acids or triglycerides at 2 and 5% levels were fed for ad libitum intake. Diets were isonitrogenous but not isocaloric. Each treatment period consisted of 28 d; the last 14 d were used for data collection. Fat-supplemented diets had no effects on DM intake, milk fat percentage, milk protein percentage, and BW compared with the control diet. Energy intake and milk yields were higher for cows fed fat-supplemented diets. Adding fatty acids to diets increased milk fat percentage above that in milk from cows fed triglyceride diets. Apparent digestibilities of DM and OM were lowered by the addition of fat, mainly in response to fatty acid additions. Feeding fatty acids reduced ash digestibility compared with feeding triglycerides, and NDF digestibility also tended to be lower for cows fed fatty acid diets. Fat addition to diets reduced fatty acid digestibility; digestibility of added fat averaged 37.7%. Although of similar saturation, the triglyceride supplement was more ruminally inert than the fatty acid supplement. Esterification and degree of saturation are features of importance when processing tallow for use in ruminant diets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Eastridge","given":"M L"},{"family":"Firkins","given":"J L"}],"citation-key":"Eastridge1991","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(91)78439-7","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["1991",8]]},"page":"2610-6","PMID":"1918535","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Feeding hydrogenated fatty acids and triglycerides to lactating dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1918535","volume":"74"},

  {"id":"Eckel2016","abstract":"The dairy industry continues to suffer severe economic losses due to the increased disease incidence cows experience during the transition period. It has long been the classical view that the major contributing factor to the development of these periparturient diseases is the considerable increase in nutritional demands for milk production. This classical view, however, fails to account for the substantial correlation between both metabolic and infectious diseases and the detrimental effects that can occur with the provision of high-energy diets to support these nutritional demands. Currently, increasing evidence implicates bacterial endotoxins in the etiopathology of most periparturient diseases. Bacterial endotoxins are components of the outer cell wall of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria that are highly immunostimulatory and can trigger proinflammatory immune responses. The ability of endotoxins to translocate from the mucosal tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract, mammary gland, and uterus, into the systemic circulation has been observed. Once they have entered the circulation, endotoxins potentially contribute to disease either directly, through eliciting an inflammatory response, or indirectly through other factors such as the overreaction of the natural protective mechanisms of the host. Although the evidence implicating a role of endotoxins in the pathogenesis of transition diseases continues to grow, our current knowledge of the host response to mucosal endotoxin exposure and pathogenic mechanisms remain largely unknown. Developing our understanding of the connection between endotoxemia and dairy cattle disease holds significant potential for the future development of preventative measures that could benefit the productivity of the dairy industry as well as animal welfare.","author":[{"family":"Eckel","given":"Emily F."},{"family":"Ametaj","given":"Burim N."}],"citation-key":"Eckel2016","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2015-10727","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"5967-5990","PMID":"27209132","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Invited review: Role of bacterial endotoxins in the etiopathogenesis of periparturient diseases of transition dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-10727","volume":"99"},
  {"id":"eckelBacterialEndotoxinsTheir2020","abstract":"During the periparturient period there is a significant increase in the incidence of multiple metabolic and infectious diseases in dairy cows. Dairy cows are fed high-grain diets immediately after calving to support production of large amounts of milk. Mounting evidence indicates these types of diets are associated with the release of high amounts of endotoxins in the rumen fluid. If infected, the udder and uterus additionally become important sources of endotoxins during the postpartum period. There is increasing evidence that endotoxins translocate from rumen, uterus, or udder into the systemic circulation and trigger chronic low-grade inflammatory conditions associated with multiple diseases including fatty liver, mastitis, retained placenta, metritis, laminitis, displaced abomasum, milk fever, and downer cow syndrome. Interestingly, endotoxin-related diseases are triggered by a bacterial component and not by a specific bacterium. This makes prevention of these type of diseases different from classical infectious diseases. Prevention of translocation of endotoxins into the host systemic circulation needs to take priority and this could be achieved with a new approach: mucosal vaccination. In this review article, we discuss all the aforementioned issues in detail and also report some of our trials with regards to mucosal vaccination of periparturient dairy cows.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Eckel","given":"Emily F."},{"family":"Ametaj","given":"Burim N."}],"citation-key":"eckelBacterialEndotoxinsTheir2020","container-title":"Dairy 2020, Vol. 1, Pages 61-90","DOI":"10.3390/DAIRY1010006","ISSN":"2624-862X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,20]]},"page":"61-90","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Bacterial Endotoxins and Their Role in Periparturient Diseases of Dairy Cows: Mucosal Vaccine Perspectives","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2624-862X/1/1/6/htm","volume":"1"},

After 48-h anaerobic incubation of mixed culture rumen fluid, rates of free fatty acid production (nmol/mL per h) for the 6 and 20% glycerol-supplemented samples were decreased by 80 and 86%, respectively, compared with rates from nonsupplemented control cultures (12.4±1.0; mean ± SE). Conversely, assay of the prominent ruminal lipase-producing bacteria Anaerovibrio lipolyticus 5S, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, and Propionibacterium species avidum and acnes revealed no effect of 2 or 10% (vol/vol) added glycerol on lipolytic activity by these organisms.

  {"id":"Egger-Danner2012","abstract":"A complex deterministic approach was used to model the breeding goal and breeding structure for the Austrian Fleckvieh (dual-purpose Simmental) breed. The reference breeding goal corresponded to the current total merit index (TMI-R), where dairy traits have a relative weight of 37.9% and fitness traits of 43.7% (beef traits 16.5%; milkability 2%). The breeding program was characterized by 280,000 cows under performance recording, 3,200 bull dams, 100 test bulls with a test capacity of 25%, and 15 proven bulls and 8 bull sires per year. The annual monetary genetic gain (AMGG) was generated mainly by increases in milk fat and milk protein yield (80.6%) and only to a small extent by fitness traits (6.6%). The inclusion of direct health traits (early reproductive disorders, cystic ovaries, and mastitis) with their economic weights increased the relative AMGG for fitness traits from 6.6 to 11.2%. The presently slightly negative AMGG for fertility index and udder health changed in a positive direction. Increasing the weight on the direct health traits by 50% resulted in a further shift toward fitness and health. The effect of strategies using genomic information in a total merit index (TMI) with varying weights on fitness and health traits was also analyzed. The conventional progeny-testing scheme was defined as the reference breeding program. A breeding program was considered to be genomically enhanced (GS50) when 50% of inseminations of herdbook cows and of bull dams were from young bulls with a genomic TMI, and a second program (GS100) did not rely on progeny-tested bulls at all. For GS50, a clear shift of the relative gain in AMGG toward fitness and health traits was observed for all 3 TMI scenarios, as a result of larger progeny groups and a shorter generation interval. For GS100, where no gene flow from progeny-tested bulls was assumed, the genetic gain per generation was lower for the fertility and udder health index but higher per year. The results based on natural genetic gain per year showed that no positive genetic response for fertility and udder health index were achieved for TMI-R (without the inclusion of direct health traits) in GS50 and GS100. The direction of the genetic trend was determined by the weights given to fertility and udder health indices within the TMI. When appropriate weights generated a clear positive trend, GS50 and GS100 reinforced this trend.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Egger-Danner","given":"C"},{"family":"Willam","given":"a"},{"family":"Fuerst","given":"C"},{"family":"Schwarzenbacher","given":"H"},{"family":"Fuerst-Waltl","given":"B"}],"citation-key":"Egger-Danner2012","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5323","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",8]]},"page":"4600-9","PMID":"22818475","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Hot topic: Effect of breeding strategies using genomic information on fitness and health.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22818475","volume":"95"},

The main objective of this study was to investigate incidence rate and duration of UCD in a 1-yr longitudinal study. Other objectives were to investigate risk factors for transitions from being healthy to having mild or severe UCD, and from having mild UCD to having severe UCD, and associations between UCD and clinical mastitis, somatic cell count (SCC) and hock lesions. Seven herds were included in the study and visited 9 times each at 6-wk intervals. At the visits, mild and severe UCD lesions, hock lesions, udder conformation traits, and hygiene scores were registered for each cow milked in the milking parlor. Information on breed, parity, days in milk (DIM), results from test milkings (milk production, SCC, and urea level), and veterinary treatments was also obtained. A UCD case was defined as one or several consecutive observations of UCD. The incidence and duration of UCD were described. Mixed-effect logistic regression models were used to analyze associations between potential risk factors and transitions to any type of UCD. Separate risk factor analyses were performed for transitions to mild and severe UCD. Associations with SCC, mastitis, and hock lesions were also analyzed with mixed-effect logistic regression models. The mean overall incidence of new UCD cases for all visits and herds was 0.5 cases per cow-year at risk. Risk factors associated with a higher risk of a transition to any type of UCD and mild UCD were breed (Swedish Red vs. Swedish Holstein), an indentation or fold at the fore udder attachment, and increasing DIM. In addition, a low milk urea level was associated with a lower risk of transition to any type of and mild UCD. Cows with previous mild UCD and high-yielding cows had increased risk for a transition to severe UCD. Cows that had an observed transition to severe UCD had an increased risk of veterinary-treated clinical mastitis within 6 wk after the UCD observation. No associations were found between UCD and SCC or hock lesions. The median observed duration of a UCD case was 12 wk, but most cases did not have an observed start or end during the study period. The observed duration of cases including severe UCD was longer than for cases involving only mild UCD. The high incidence and often long duration of UCD emphasize the need for preventive measures and treatment strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Ekman","given":"L."},{"family":"Nyman","given":"A.

Recently, bacterial resistance to antibiotics due to uncontrolled usage became one of the most serious problems facing the medical community, so, the aim of study was to detect the effectiveness of nano-silver particles as a treatment for postpartum endometritis in dairy Holstein cows. At 35-40 days postpartum, twenty one Holstein cows were diagnosed to be affected with postpartum endometritis, depending on clinical and ultrasonography examination. The treatment protocol included intrauterine infusion with 50 ml of silver nanoparticles solution (50 ppm/ml) for five consecutive days, and single dose of PGF-2α analogue as a treatment for animals with a corpus lutetum on their ovaries. At the 7th day post-treatment, serum level tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid-A (SAA) and was significantly decreased (P<0.01). Also, the level of ceruloplasmin and haptoglobin (Hp) in serum recorded a significant decrement(P<0.05) upon treatment with silver nanoparticles.In addition, uterine secretions were found with a significant decrease or disappeared completely, and endometrial thickness decrement was detected upon ultrasonography examination. At re-examination (49-54 days postpartum), 14 animals out of 21 animals (66.6%) were recovered successfully from endometritis.

The most effective doses obtained from the in vitro experiment were evaluated in vivo using 30 Barki goats (26 ± 0.9 SE kg body weight). Goats were allocated into three dietary treatments (n = 10/treatment) as follows: control (basal diet without any supplementations), natural zeolite (20 g/kg DM diet), and nano-zeolite (0.40 g/kg DM diet). The in vitro results revealed that only the nano-zeolite supplementation form quadratically (p= 0.004) increased GP, and the level of 0.5 g/kg DM had the highest GP value compared to the control. Both zeolite forms affected the CH4 production, linear, and quadratic reductions (p < 0.05) in CH4 (mL/g DM), consistent with linear increases in truly degraded organic matter (TDOM) (p = 0.09), and propionate molar proportions (p = 0.007) were observed by nano zeolite treatment, while the natural form of zeolite resulted in a linear CH4 reduction consistent with a linear decrease (p = 0.004) in NH3-N, linear increases in TDOM (p = 0.09), and propionate molar proportions (p = 0.004). Results of the in vivo experiment demonstrated that the nutrient digestibility was similar among all treatments. Nano zeolite enhanced (p < 0.05) the total short-chain fatty acids and butyrate concentrations, while both zeolite forms decreased (p < 0.001) NH3-N compared to the control.

Treatments consisted of no supplementation (CTRL) or supplementation (AGL) of 1 g/d of Agolin Ruminant (Agolin, Bière, Switzerland) in the TMR. All cows were fed a common TMR (just differing in the presence or absence of Agolin Ruminant) twice daily. Milk production, milk composition, and feed intake of individual cows were recorded daily, and feed efficiency was calculated. Rumen fluid samples were collected from all cows throughout the study to determine pH and VFA profile and estimate methane concentrations.\nResults and Discussion\nCompared with CTRL, cows fed AGL produced more ECM after 4 wk of exposure to treatments, and because DMI did not differ between treatments, feed efficiency increased over time. Estimated rumen methane concentrations of cows fed AGL were lower compared with those fed CTRL during wk 4 to 8.\nImplications and Applications\nIt is concluded that Agolin Ruminant increased milk production and feed efficiency after 4 wk of feeding the additive.

  {"id":"elghandour2024","abstract":"An important aspect of live yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) inclusion in the diets of ruminants is improved animal productivity. Inclusion of yeasts in ruminant diets may alter rumen microbes and their metabolites and promote a favorable intestinal microflora by increasing the population of beneficial microorganisms. Beneficial microbes compete for nutrients and attachment sites with pathogens, thereby reducing the growth of harmful microbes in the rumen. Yeasts enhance growth and average daily weight gain of animals by improving nutrients digestion and absorption. Probiotics can alter the fatty acid composition of meat and milk, and it is common knowledge that a lower fatty acid profile may directly confer health benefits to consumers by reducing harmful cholesterol levels in animal products and thus favorable to human nutrition. Furthermore, yeast probiotics have been shown to enhance immunity by inducing an immunomodulatory effect on the animal in addition to their ability to lower cholesterol, adhesion properties of the intestinal mucosa, and colonial resistance to strengthen gut integrity. This review highlights that yeast probiotics play a role in the ruminal microbial population dynamics, cholesterollowering ability and immunostimulatory potentials, yeast adhesion properties, and colonial resistance. Additional benefits include a healthy gut with concomitant increase in animal productivity, nutrient digestion, and absorption and general animal welfare.

  {"id":"Elhanafy2013","abstract":"Jejunal hemorrhage syndrome (JHS) is an acute, highly fatal enterotoxemic disorder in dairy cattle that has been reported during the last few decades. No specific cause of this syndrome has been identified; however, several studies have revealed a strong association between JHS and infection with Clostridium perfringens type A. A common mold, Aspergillus fumigatus, has also been implicated as a potential causative agent in this disease syndrome. Clinical signs of JHS (including sudden decreases in feed intake and milk production, rapid loss of condition, a right-sided ping audible during simultaneous auscultation and percussion of the abdomen, abdominal distension, and melena or bloody feces) usually develop early during lactation when cattle receive rations that are high in energy and low in fiber. Appropriate preventive strategies have not yet been determined, and intensive medical management with or without surgical intervention is rarely successful. The use of commercially available vaccines that are directed against C perfringens types C and D is of questionable efficacy and not likely to be helpful as a preventative measure. This article highlights the potential etiologic and risk factors, describes common clinical signs, outlines relevant diagnostic testing, and summarizes treatment options and their outcomes.","author":[{"family":"Elhanafy","given":"Mohamed M."},{"family":"French","given":"Dennis D."},{"family":"Braun","given":"Ueli"}],"citation-key":"Elhanafy2013","container-title":"Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.243.3.352","ISBN":"1943-569X; 0003-1488","ISSN":"0003-1488","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"352-358","PMID":"23865877","title":"Understanding jejunal hemorrhage syndrome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.243.3.352","volume":"243"},

Recent years have witnessed a significant scientific interest on vitamin D and expanded its actions to include immune modulation, cell differentiation and proliferation and inflammation regulation. As our understanding of the many functions of vitamin D has grown, the presence of vitamin D deficiency has become one of the most prevalent micronutrient deficiencies worldwide. Concomitantly, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common form of chronic liver disease in western countries. NAFLD and vitamin D deficiency often coexist and epidemiologic evidence has shown that both of these conditions share several cardiometabolic risk factors.

  {"id":"Eliyahu2015","abstract":"This study examined the chemical composition, in vitro and in vivo digestibility, aerobic stability and ensiling capability of the fresh wet fibrous by-products Aspergillus residue, soy pulp (okara), pomegranate pulp, grape pulp and avocado pulp. Ensiling was assessed in glass silos, and aerobic stability in open PVC containers. Intake and in vivo digestibility were measured in mature male Assaf lambs (four lambs/replicates per dietary treatment) held in individual metabolic cages, and ad libitum-fed one of the total mixed rations containing the examined fresh by-product and appropriate supplement. Aspergillus residue is an acidic, fibrous by-product, characterized by high in vivo digestibility of organic matter (OM, 0.85) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF, 0.95), and high stability under aerobic exposure. Ensiling results give large dry matter (DM) losses (41.2%) and continuous yeast fermentation to ethanol and volatiles. Okara is an acidic, fibrous by-product that is rich in protein (290g/kg DM), characterized by high in vivo digestibility of OM and NDF (0.88 and 0.93, respectively), but low stability under aerobic exposure. It can be ensiled with moderate DM losses (16%), producing butyrate and acetate. Pomegranate pulp contains high levels of soluble phenolics and sugars and its voluntary consumption by sheep is low. When fed to sheep it is characterized by low in vivo OM and NDF digestibility (0.44 and 0.20, respectively), and low aerobic stability. However, it can be ensiled with moderate DM losses (20%). Grape is rich in ethanol and avocado pulps in fat content, and both byproducts are rich in lignin content and therefore have low in vivo OM digestibility (0.30 and 0.43, respectively) originating from their low NDF digestibility (0.12 and 0.31, respectively).

  {"id":"elmhadi2022","abstract":"Dairy cattle are frequently fed high-concentrate (HC) diets in modern intensive feeding systems, especially in the transition period. During this period, cows face many alterations that include hormonal changes and shifting to a lactating state. Switching to a HC diet that may disrupt the ruminal microbiota balance can lead to subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA). Moreover, the main factor shaping the rumen microbiota is dietary composition, especially the ratio of starch to fibrous carbohydrates. Feeding highly fermentable carbohydrate diets after adaptation to forage diets leads to a rumen fermentation rate that exceeds rumen absorption and buffering rates, resulting in a reduction in ruminal pH. As a result of Gram-negative bacterial cell lysis, an increase in harmful ruminal bacterial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide, lactic acid, and histamine, is observed. The interactions between the host immune system and the ruminal microbiota play an essential role in many physiological processes and the development of the disorder. Progress in DNA sequencing and bioinformatics platforms provides new opportunities to investigate the composition of ruminal microbes and yields unique advances in understanding ecology of the rumen. Subacute ruminal acidosis is linked with a change in the ruminal microbiota structure and richness and with other metabolic disorders; such as rumenitis, milk fat depression, laminitis, and liver abscesses. Therefore, this review aims to explore a better understanding of the crosstalk between diet and microbiota in the prevalence of rumen acidosis and its consequences, which is crucial for control strategies such as feeding management, and supplementation with thiamine, prebiotics, and probiotics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Elmhadi","given":"Mawada E."},{"family":"Ali","given":"Darien K."},{"family":"Khogali","given":"Mawahib K."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Hongrong"}],"citation-key":"elmhadi2022","container-title":"Animal Nutrition","container-title-short":"Animal Nutrition","DOI":"10.1016/j.aninu.2021.12.008","ISSN":"2405-6545","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,1]]},"page":"148-155","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Subacute ruminal acidosis in dairy herds: Microbiological and nutritional causes, consequences, and prevention strategies","title-short":"Subacute ruminal acidosis in dairy herds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405654522000312","volume":"10"},

Cows were fed a basal diet [pre-calving: 1.53 Mcal/kg dry matter (DM) and post-calving: 1.70 Mcal/kg DM] with or without supplemental ruminally protected amino acids (RPAA). Treatments were the basal diets without supplemental amino acids (CONTROL, n = 30), with supplemental methionine (RPM, pre-calving at 0.16% of DM and post-calving at 0.12% of DM, n = 30), with supplemental lysine (RPL, pre-calving at 0.33% of DM and post-calving at 0.24% DM, n = 30), and the combination (RPML, pre-calving at 0.16% RPM + 0.33% RPL of DM and post-calving at 0.12% RPM + 0.24 % RPL DM, n = 30). The dietary content of lysine was balanced to be within 6.157.2% metabolizable protein (MP)–lysine and that of methionine was balanced within 2.1–2.35% MP-methionine. Dry matter intake (DMI) was measured daily. Milk samples were taken on d 7, 14, and 21 days relative to calving (DRC), and milk yields were measured daily. Blood samples were taken on d −21, −14, −7 before expected calving and d 0, 7, 14, and 21 DRC. Data were analyzed using SAS software. There were significant Trt × time interactions (P < 0.01) for DMI pre- and post-calving period. The CON cows had lower DMI than RPM, RPL, and RPML, both pre-calving (P < 0.01) and post-calving periods (P < 0.01). Energy-corrected milk (P < 0.01), milk fat (P < 0.01), protein (P = 0.02), and lactose (P < 0.01) percentage levels were greater for RPM, RPL, and RPML cows compared to CON. Supplementing RPAA assisted in maintaining BCS post-calving than CON (P < 0.01). Blood concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate decreased with RPM or RPL or the combination pre-calving (P < 0.01) and tended to decrease post-calving (P = 0.10). These results demonstrated that feeding RPL and RPM improved DMI and milk production efficiency, maintained BCS, and reduced β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations of transition cows.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Elsaadawy","given":"Samy A."},{"family":"Wu","given":"Zaohai"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Han"},{"family":"Hanigan","given":"Mark D."},{"family":"Bu","given":"Dengpan"}],"citation-key":"elsaadawySupplementingRuminallyProtected2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Veterinary Science","DOI":"10.3389/FVETS.2022.780637","ISSN":"22971769","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,25]]},"page":"780637","PMID":"35400096","publisher":"Frontiers Media SA","title":"Supplementing Ruminally Protected Lysine, Methionine, or Combination Improved Milk Production in Transition Dairy Cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"/pmc/articles/PMC8990851/","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"elsohaby2019","abstract":"The primary objective of this observational study was to examine the association between passive transfer of immunity and growth performance in preweaning calves. A secondary objective was to evaluate the utility of a heart girth tape (HGT) to estimate body weight (BW) in preweaning calves. A total of 142 Holstein calves were enrolled in this study. Blood samples were collected 24 to 48 hours after birth and serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration for each calf was measured by radial immunodiffusion assay. Calf BW was determined at birth, at 21 days, and at weaning using an electronic scale (ES) and HGT. A significant positive association was detected between serum IgG and both BW at 21 days and average daily gain (ADG) from 0 to 21 days of life. Additionally, ADG from 0 to 42 days of life showed a trend toward an improved rate of gain as IgG concentration increased. The Pearson correlation coefficient between BW obtained from ES and HGT was 0.81 at birth, 0.86 at 21 days, and 0.83 at weaning. The mean differences between BW obtained from ES and HGT were −3.1 kg at birth, −3.2 kg at 21 days, and −7.7 kg at weaning. In conclusion, serum IgG concentration in neonatal calves is an important contributing factor for the variation in growth performance of preweaning calves. The HGT can be used to estimate the BW of preweaning calves but has a tendency to overestimate weight, especially at weaning compared to birth and 21 days of age.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Elsohaby","given":"Ibrahim"},{"family":"Cameron","given":"Marguerite"},{"family":"Elmoslemany","given":"Ahmed"},{"family":"McClure","given":"J.

Rumen and colon tissues (n = 8), obtained from slaughtered feedlot steers, were tested for changes in permeability to (3)H-mannitol under pH of 4.5, 5.5, and 6.5 for rumen and at 5.5, 6.5, and 7.4 for colon, with or without LPS from Escherichia coli B:055 at 500 microg/mL. The (3)H-Mannitol was added at 10 microL (525.4 GBq/mmol) on the mucosal side of the Ussing chamber to detect changes in permeability, and 4 samples were taken at 20, 25, 30, and 35 min from the serosal side. Permeability of rumen and colon mucosa to (3)H-mannitol increased 6- and 5-fold, respectively, at acidic pH values of 4.5 and 5.5 and in the presence of 500 micro/mL of LPS. In contrast, LPS did not affect rumen and colon permeability at pH that ranged from 5.5 and 7.4. Translocation of LPS across the rumen and colon mucosa of cattle was not pH dependent. The LPS translocated through these tissues if present at the mucosal side. In conclusion, the permeability of rumen and colon tissues to (3)H-mannitol increased in presence of LPS and under acidic pH, whereas LPS permeated through mucosal tissues independently of the pH of the perfusate.

This study is the first to quantify the transfer of QAs from BSL into cow’s milk with experimental and modeling methods. Four lactating dairy cows were subjected to two 7 day feeding periods with 1 and 2 kg/d BSL, respectively, each followed by a depuration period. BSL contained 1774 mg/kg dry matter total QAs. Individual milk samples were taken twice daily and QA contents in feed and milk determined with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Transfer of QAs into the milk was already seen with the administration of 1 kg/d BSL, with differences in transfer rates (TRs) between individual QAs. A toxicokinetic model was derived to quantify and predict QA feed-to-food transfer. For the four most prominent QAs, our model shows an α-half-life of around 0.27 d. TRs were obtained for six QAs and were between 0.13 (sparteine) and 3.74% (multiflorine).

Forty Holstein heifer calves were fed a texturized calf starter (23.4% crude protein, 32.3% starch on a dry matter basis) and chopped Klein grass hay as separate components (CONT) or the same starter and hay mixed at a 90:10 ratio on an as-fed basis (MIX) ad libitum from the date transported to the research farm (4–7 d of life) to 90 d of life. Calves were provided milk replacer (28% crude protein, 15% fat) at up to 557 g/d before the study, 737 g/d from d 14 to 20, 1,105 g/d from d 21 to 41, 737 g/d from d 42 to 48, and 557 g/d from d 49 to 55 on a dry matter basis. calves were fully weaned on d 56. Feed sorting for the MIX calves was evaluated using the Penn State Particle Separator; the sorting index was calculated as the actual intake as a percentage of predicted intake, with values >100% indicating sorting for and values <100% indicating sorting against. Treatment did not affect solid feed intake, growth performance, or plasma metabolite or hormone concentration during the preweaning or weaning periods. However, calves in the MIX treatment had less neutral detergent fiber intake as a percentage of solid feed intake than CONT calves in the preweaning (23.3 vs. 37.0%) and weaning (23.5 vs. 25.8%) periods, although MIX calves sorted (107.2%) for long particles, which were primarily hay, during weaning. During the postweaning period, MIX calves had greater neutral detergent fiber intake as a percentage of solid feed intake compared with CONT calves (23.4 vs. 22.7%), although they sorted against long particles (84.4%), and decreased solid feed dry matter intake compared with CONT calves (3,292 vs. 3,536 g/d) and average daily gain (1.20 vs. 1.31 kg/d). Weaned calves in the MIX treatment also had lower plasma concentration of glucagon-like peptide 2 compared with CONT (0.46 vs. 0.77 ng/mg) but had higher plasma concentrations of ghrelin (0.05 vs. 0.03 ng/mg).

Three primiparous and 21 multiparous Holstein cows were utilized in this experiment.

Liver Cu concentrations were higher in Cu supplemented cows at the end of the 61-d study. Cows receiving 40 mg of Cu/kg of DM had higher liver Cu concentrations than cows receiving 10 mg of Cu. Plasma Cu concentrations were similar across treatments. Total serum cholesterol concentrations were higher in cows receiving supplemental Cu. Cows receiving 40 mg of Cu/kg of DM had higher serum cholesterol concentrations than cows receiving 10 mg of Cu. Dry matter intake, average daily milk production, and milk lipid, protein, and somatic cell numbers were similar across treatments. On d 61, milk fatty acids C18:1 trans and C18-conjugated dienes were lower in cows receiving supplemental Cu relative to the nonsupplemented controls. Cows receiving 40 mg of Cu/kg of DM had higher C12:0 and lower C18:2 and total polyunsaturated fatty acids in milk than cows receiving 10 mg of Cu/kg of DM. These results indicate that Cu supplementation alters lipid metabolism in high producing dairy cows and that Cu supplementation at 40 mg/kg of DM for 61 d can elevate liver Cu concentrations to levels considered to be marginally toxic in dairy cattle.","author":[{"family":"Engle","given":"T.E."},{"family":"Fellner","given":"V."},{"family":"Spears","given":"J.W."}],"citation-key":"Engle2001","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(01)74678-4","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"page":"2308-2313","PMID":"11699463","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Copper Status, Serum Cholesterol, and Milk Fatty Acid Profile in Holstein Cows Fed Varying Concentrations of Copper","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030201746784","volume":"84"},

The objective of this study was to determine the separate effects of high arterial concentrations of 16:0, 18:0 and cis-18:1(n-9) on uptake, synthesis and 18:0 desaturation rate in the mammary gland of lactating dairy cows, via arterio-venous differences and mammary gland balance of FA. In a 4 x 4 Latin square, four lactating Holstein cows with cannula in the proximal duodenum were infused duodenally with a mixture providing daily 0 (C treatment) or 500 g FA with mainly 16:0 (P treatment), 18:0 (S treatment) or cis-18:1(n-9) (O treatment). Significantly higher arterial concentrations of infused FA in arterial plasma nonesterified FA and triglycerides (NETGFA) were observed with P and O treatments, but the effect of the S treatment was much lower. Arterio-venous differences of NETGFA increased with arterial concentrations. The number of synthesized FA in the mammary gland was not significantly affected by duodenal infusion of FA. Mean chain length was significantly reduced by P and O treatments, suggesting an effect of mammary gland uptake of long-chain FA on the termination process of mammary gland synthesis of FA. Across all treatments, 4:0 mammary gland balance increased linearly (r = 0.67, P = 0.004) with mammary gland FA uptake. Mammary gland desaturation of 18:0 to cis-18:1(n-9) averaged 52% and was not significantly affected by treatments, but was reduced by trans-18:1 mammary gland uptake. Uptake, synthesis and desaturation of FA by the mammary gland of dairy cows are affected by arterial concentrations of 16:0, 18:0 and cis-18:1(n-9).","author":[{"family":"Enjalbert","given":"F"},{"family":"Nicot","given":"M C"},{"family":"Bayourthe","given":"C"},{"family":"Moncoulon","given":"R"}],"citation-key":"Enjalbert1998","container-title":"The Journal of nutrition","ISSN":"0022-3166","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",9]]},"page":"1525-32","PMID":"9732314","title":"Duodenal infusions of palmitic, stearic or oleic acids differently affect mammary gland metabolism of fatty acids in lactating dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9732314","volume":"128"},
  {"id":"Enjalbert2003","abstract":"Raw or extruded blends of ground canola seeds and canola meal were used to compare in vitro and in situ lag times and rates of disappearance due to ruminal biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids. The in situ study resulted in higher lag times for biohydrogenation for polyunsaturated fatty acids and lower rates of biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids than the in vitro study, so the in situ biohydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids was not complete at 24 h of incubation. With both methods, rates of biohydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids were higher than for cis-delta9C18:1. Extrusion did not affect the rate of biohydrogenation of cis-delta9C18:1, but resulted in higher rates of biohydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids with higher proportions of trans intermediates of biohydrogenation at 4 h of incubation in vitro and at 8 h of incubation in situ. These results suggest that extrusion affects the isomerization of polyunsaturated fatty acids, rather than the hydrogenation steps. In conclusion, in vitro and in situ methods can both show differences of ruminal metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids due to processing, but the methods provide very different estimates of the rates of disappearance due to biohydrogenation.","author":[{"family":"Enjalbert","given":"F"},{"family":"Eynard","given":"P"},{"family":"Nicot","given":"M C"},{"family":"Troegeler-Meynadier","given":"a"},{"family":"Bayourthe","given":"C"}],"citation-key":"Enjalbert2003","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",1]]},"page":"351-9","PMID":"12613878","title":"In vitro versus in situ ruminal biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids from a raw or extruded mixture of ground canola seed/canola meal.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12613878","volume":"86"},
  {"id":"enriquez-hidalgoIncorporatingFreshMixed2020","abstract":"The winter diet of dairy cows in Mediterranean climate regions is usually a total mixed ration with a base of conserved summer crops such as corn silage and alfalfa hay. However, there is increased labor and financial cost related to this kind of feeding, which could be reduced if fresh forages were used in place of some of the conserved forage in the cow diet. The objective of our study was to evaluate the effect of including fresh mixed annual ryegrass and berseem clover into the diet of dairy cows on milk, nitrogen utilization and methane emission. Twenty-four lactating dairy cows were split into two groups and offered either a diet similar to that usually offered to the cows (CON) or one where a mixture of fresh annual ryegrass and berseem clover was used to partially substitute the corn silage and alfalfa hay in the diet (MIX). Milk yield was recorded automatically, and methane emissions were estimated using the SF6 tracer technique. The MIX diet had lower crude protein concentration (148 vs. 170 g/kg DM) but higher DM digestibility (81.6 vs. 78.6%) than the CON diet. Compared to the cows offered the CON diet, milk yield was reduced when cows were fed the MIX diet (36.4 vs. 31.9 kg/d), but methane emissions (381 vs. 332 g/d) and nitrogen excretion were also reduced (238 vs. 180 g/d). Nitrogen use efficiency was unaffected (30.8%). In addition, milk from cows fed the MIX diet had a fatty acid profile considered to be more beneficial to human health than that of the milk from cows fed the CON diet. Increasing the protein concentration in the MIX diet, either by direct supplementation or increasing the proportion of legume in the mixed herbage, could overcome the reduction on milk and positively affect methane emission and N use efficiency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Enriquez-Hidalgo","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Teixeira","given":"Dayane Lemos"},{"family":"Pinheiro Machado Filho","given":"Luiz Carlos"},{"family":"Hennessy","given":"Deirdre"},{"family":"Toro-Mujica","given":"Paula"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Shaun Richard Owen"},{"family":"Pereira","given":"Fabiellen Cristina"}],"citation-key":"enriquez-hidalgoIncorporatingFreshMixed2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Veterinary Science","DOI":"10.3389/FVETS.2020.576944","ISSN":"2297-1769","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,20]]},"page":"935","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Incorporating a Fresh Mixed Annual Ryegrass and Berseem Clover Forage Into the Winter Diet of Dairy Cows Resulted in Reduced Milk Yield, but Reduced Nitrogen Excretion and Reduced Methane Yield","type":"article-journal","volume":"0"},

  {"id":"Ertl2016","abstract":"Besides the widely discussed negative environmental effects of dairy production, such as greenhouse gas emissions, the feeding of large amounts of potentially human-edible feedstuffs to dairy cows is another important sustainability concern. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the effects of a complete substitution of common cereal grains and pulses with a mixture of wheat bran and sugar beet pulp in a high-forage diet on cow performance, production efficiency, feed intake, and ruminating behavior, as well as on net food production potential. Thirteen multiparous and 7 primiparous mid-lactation Holstein dairy cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments in a change-over design with 7-wk periods. Cows were fed a high-forage diet (grass silage and hay accounted for 75% of the dry matter intake), supplemented with either a cereal grain-based concentrate mixture (CON), or a mixture of wheat bran and dried sugar beet pulp (WBBP). Human-edible inputs were calculated for 2 different scenarios based on minimum and maximum potential recovery rates of human-edible energy and protein from the respective feedstuffs. Dietary starch and neutral detergent fiber contents were 3.0 and 44.1% for WBBP, compared with 10.8 and 38.2% in CON, respectively. Dietary treatment did not affect milk production, milk composition, feed intake, or total chewing activity. However, chewing index expressed in minutes per kilogram of neutral detergent fiber ingested was 12% lower in WBBP compared with CON. In comparison to CON, the human-edible feed conversion efficiencies for energy and protein, defined as human-edible output per human-edible input, were 6.8 and 5.3 times higher, respectively, in WBBP under the maximum scenario. For the maximum scenario, the daily net food production (human-edible output minus human-edible input) increased from 5.4 MJ and 250 g of crude protein per cow in CON to 61.5 MJ and 630 g of crude protein in the WBBP diet. In conclusion, our data suggest that in forage-based dairy production systems, wheat bran and sugar beet pulp could replace common cereal grains in mid-lactation dairy cows without impairing performance, while strongly increasing human-edible feed conversion efficiency and net food production index.","author":[{"family":"Ertl","given":"P."},{"family":"Zebeli","given":"Q."},{"family":"Zollitsch","given":"W."},{"family":"Knaus","given":"W."}],"citation-key":"Ertl2016","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2015-10285","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"1228-1236","PMID":"26709167","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Feeding of wheat bran and sugar beet pulp as sole supplements in high-forage diets emphasizes the potential of dairy cattle for human food supply","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030215009339","volume":"99"},

  {"id":"Fan2015","abstract":"Use of feed antibiotics as growth promoters for control of pathogens associated with monogastric food animal morbidity and mortality has contributed to the development of antimicrobial resistance, which has now become a threat to public health on a global scale. Presently, a number of alternative feed additives have been developed and are divided into two major categories, including 1) the ones that are supposed to directly and indirectly control pathogenic bacterial proliferation; and 2) the other ones that are intended to up-regulate host gut mucosal trophic growth, whole body growth performance and active immunity. A thorough review of literature reports reveal that efficacy responses of current alternative feed additives in replacing feed antibiotics to improve performances and gut health are generally inconsistent dependent upon experimental conditions. Current alternative feed additives typically have no direct detoxification effects on endotoxin lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and this is likely the major reason that their effects are limited. It is now understood that pathogenic bacteria mediate their negative effects largely through LPS interactions with toll-like receptor 4, causing immune responses and infectious diseases. Therefore, disruptive biological strategies and a novel and new generation of feed additives need to be developed to replace feed antibiotic growth promoters and to directly and effectively detoxify the endotoxin LPS and improve gut health and performance in monogastric food animals.","author":[{"family":"Fan","given":"Ming Z."},{"family":"Archbold","given":"Tania"}],"citation-key":"Fan2015","container-title":"Animal Nutrition","DOI":"10.1016/j.aninu.2015.10.002","ISSN":"24056383","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"138-143","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Novel and disruptive biological strategies for resolving gut health challenges in monogastric food animal production","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aninu.2015.10.002","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"Farmer2014","abstract":"This experiment evaluated the effect of feeding a lower starch diet (21% of dry matter) with different amounts of forage (52, 47, 43, and 39% of dry matter) on lactational performance, chewing activity, ruminal fermentation and turnover, microbial N yield, and total-tract nutrient digestibility. Dietary forage consisted of a mixture of corn and haycrop silages, and as dietary forage content was reduced, chopped wheat straw (0-10% of dry matter) was added in an effort to maintain chewing activity. Dietary concentrate was adjusted (corn meal, nonforage fiber sources, and protein sources) to maintain similar amounts of starch and other carbohydrate and protein fractions among the diets. Sixteen lactating Holstein cows were used in replicated 4 × 4 Latin squares with 21-d periods. Dry matter intake increased while physically effective neutral detergent fiber (peNDF1.18) intake was reduced as forage content decreased from 52 to 39%. However, reducing dietary forage did not influence milk yield or composition, although we observed changes in dry matter intake. Time spent chewing, eating, and ruminating (expressed as minutes per day or as minutes per kilogram of NDF intake) were not affected by reducing dietary forage. However, addition of chopped wheat straw to the diets resulted in greater time spent chewing and eating per kilogram of peNDF1.18 consumed. Reducing dietary forage from 52 to 39% did not affect ruminal pH, ruminal digesta volume and mass, ruminal pool size of NDF or starch, ruminal digesta mat consistency, or microbial N yield. Ruminal acetate-to-propionate ratio was reduced, ruminal turnover rates of NDF and starch were greater, and total-tract digestibility of fiber diminished as dietary forage content decreased. Reducing the dietary forage content from 52 to 39% of dry matter, while increasing wheat straw inclusion to maintain chewing and rumen function, resulted in similar milk yield and composition although feed intake increased.

  {"id":"Farney2013","abstract":"Multiple lines of inquiry have suggested that a high degree of inflammation in early lactation cows is associated with low productivity and increased disease incidence. In addition, some small studies have suggested that milk production increases in response to antiinflammatory treatment in the first week of lactation. Our objective was to determine if administration of sodium salicylate (SS), a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), in the first week of lactation changes whole-lactation productivity and retention in the herd. At calving, 78 cows [n=39 primiparous (1P); n=24 second parity (2P); n=15 third parity or greater (3P)] were alternately assigned to either control (CON) or SS treatments for 7d postpartum. Sodium salicylate treatment was administered via individual water bowls at a concentration of 1.95g/L, delivering a mean of 123.3±5.5g of salicylate/d during the 7-d treatment. For the first 21d of lactation, dry matter intake, water intake, milk yield, and health were monitored daily, and milk samples were collected twice weekly for milk component analysis. Monthly milk yield and component testing through the rest of the lactation provided data to assess long-term responses, and the effects of treatment on the risk of leaving the herd and on 305-d milk, fat, and protein yields were assessed. During the first 21d of lactation, we observed no differences in morbidity, except for increased risk of metritis in 3P SS cows. Treatment interacted with parity to influence both 305-d milk and milk fat yields, and a tendency for an interaction was detected for 305-d milk protein yield. Milk yield was 2,469±646kg greater over the lactation in 3P SS cows compared with 3P CON cows (21% increase) and tended to decrease by 8% in 1P cows treated with SS; no effects were detected in 2P cows. Furthermore, 3P SS cows produced 130±23kg more milk fat over the lactation (30% increase), with no effects detected for 1P or 2P. Treatment with SS tended to increase 305-d milk protein yield in 3P cows by 14%, with no effects in 1P or 2P cows. A tendency for a treatment × parity interaction was also observed for the risk of leaving the herd. First-parity cows treated with SS tended to have greater risk of leaving the herd than controls (30 vs. 6% risk); however, treatment did not alter herd retention in 2P or 3P groups, and SS had no effect on the risk of leaving the herd overall. Results indicate that SS has long-term effects on lactation of mature dairy cows, particularly on fat yield, but may have negative effects for primiparous cows.","author":[{"family":"Farney","given":"J.

Whole blood samples were taken on −14 ± 0.5, −7 ± 0.5, 7 ± 0.9, and 14 ± 0.9 d relative to calving for oxidative burst and phagocytic capacity of monocytes and neutrophils. Liver samples were collected via a biopsy on −12 ± 4.95 and 13 ± 2.62 d relative to calving and analyzed for liver composition (triacylglyceride and carnitine concentrations), mRNA expression of hepatic genes, and protein abundance. Protein abundance was calculated by normalizing intensity bands for a specific protein with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Concentrations of haptoglobin and glutathione peroxidase activity in plasma were lower at d 0 for cows in PRE-L (102 µg/mL and 339 nmol/min per mL, respectively) compared with cows in PRE-C (165 µg/mL and 405 nmol/min per mL, respectively). Oxidative burst capacity in monocytes tended to be greater on d 7 postpartum for cows in PRE-L (65.6%) than cows in PRE-C (57.5%). Additionally, feeding RPL altered the mRNA expression in liver tissue prepartum [decreased INSR (insulin receptor), CPT1A (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A), and IL1B (interleukin 1 β)] and postpartum [increased IL8 (interleukin 8), EHMT2 (euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 2), TSPO (translocator protein), and SLC3A2 (solute carrier family 3 member 2); and decreased SLC7A1 (solute carrier family 7 member 1), SOD1 (superoxide dismutase 1), and SAA3 (serum amyloid A 3)] compared with cows not consuming RPL]. Additionally, cows in the PRE-C prepartum and PRE-L postpartum treatment tended to have greater protein abundance of mTOR postpartum compared with the PRE-C prepartum and postpartum treatment. Protein abundance of SLC7A7 (solute carrier family 7 member 7) pre- and postpartum tended to be greater and BBOX1 (gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase 1) tended to be less when RPL was consumed prepartum.

Prepartum (–28 d to calving), animals were fed a diet (forage, 68% of dietary DM) with RPL [PRE-L; 0.54% RPL of dietary dry matter intake (DMI)] or without RPL (control; PRE-C). After calving, half of the cows from each prepartum treatment group were assigned to a diet (forage, 55.5% of dietary DM) with RPL (PRE-L POST-L; PRE-C POST-L; 0.40% RPL of dietary DMI) or without RPL (PRE-C POST-C; PRE-L POST-C) until d 28 postpartum. Cows were milked twice a day and milk samples were taken on 7 ± 1.3, 14 ± 1.4, and 28 ± 1.1 d relative to calving (DRC). Milk yield and DMI were recorded daily. Blood samples were taken for plasma AA analysis on −7 ± 0.5, 0 ± 0.5, 7 ± 0.9, and 14 ± 0.9 DRC. Cows in PRE-L had greater body weight at −2 and −1 wk before calving compared with those in PRE-C, though body weight change from wk −4 to −1 was not different. Body weight (717 ± 6 kg) was greater and DMI (18.1 ± 0.7 kg) tended to be greater for cows in PRE-L POST-L and PRE-L POST-C compared with those that were in PRE-C POST-L and PRE-C POST-C (707 ± 6 and 16.8 ± 0.7 kg, respectively). Energy-corrected milk (48.8 ± 1.9 kg/d), milk fat (1.9 ± 0.1 kg/d), milk true protein (1.4 ± 0.1 kg/d), milk casein (0.6 ± 0.04 kg/d), and milk lactose yields (2.1 ± 0.1 kg/d) were greater for cows in PRE-L POST-L and PRE-L POST-C compared with those that were in PRE-C POST-L and PRE-C POST-C (44.2 ± 1.9, 1.7 ± 0.1, 1.3 ± 0.1, 0.5 ± 0.04, 1.9 ± 0.1 kg/d, respectively). Plasma concentrations of Lys prepartum (69.8 ± 1.8 µM) increased for cows in PRE-L compared with those in PRE-C (62.5 ± 1.3 µM). In conclusion, RPL consumed prepartum tended to increase postpartum DMI and increased energy-corrected milk and milk component yields. This indicates that prepartum supply of intestinally available Lys is pertinent to postpartum performance. However, postpartum supply of intestinally available Lys had no effect on cows' performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Fehlberg","given":"L.

  {"id":"fernandez2017","abstract":"The history of dairy farming goes back thousands of years, evolving from a traditional small-scale production to the industrialized manufacturing of fermented dairy products. Commercialization of milk and its derived products has been very important not only as a source of nourishment but also as an economic resource. However, the dairy industry has encountered several problems that have to be overcome to ensure the quality and safety of the final products, as well as to avoid economic losses. Within this context, it is interesting to highlight the role played by bacteriophages, or phages, viruses that infect bacteria. Indeed, bacteriophages were originally regarded as a nuisance, being responsible for fermentation failure and economic losses when infecting lactic acid bacteria, but are now considered promising antimicrobials to fight milk-borne pathogens without contributing to the increase in antibiotic resistance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Fernández","given":"Lucía"},{"family":"Escobedo","given":"Susana"},{"family":"Gutiérrez","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Portilla","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Martínez","given":"Beatriz"},{"family":"García","given":"Pilar"},{"family":"Rodríguez","given":"Ana"}],"citation-key":"fernandez2017","container-title":"Antibiotics","container-title-short":"Antibiotics (Basel)","DOI":"10.3390/antibiotics6040027","ISSN":"2079-6382","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,8]]},"page":"27","PMCID":"PMC5745470","PMID":"29117107","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Bacteriophages in the Dairy Environment: From Enemies to Allies","title-short":"Bacteriophages in the Dairy Environment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5745470/","volume":"6"},

Silages with no additives served as control. Fresh forages were sampled prior to ensiling. Three jars per treatment were sampled on days 2, 4, 8, 16 and 60 after ensiling, for chemical and microbiological analysis. At the end of the ensiling period, the silages were subjected to an aerobic stability test. The P. acidipropionici-inoculated silages had significantly higher levels of acetic and propionic acid than the L. plantarum or P. acidipropionici + L. plantarum-inoculated silages (P < 0.05). Therefore, yeast activity was impaired in the P. acidipropionici-inoculated silages. As a result, P. acidipropionici decreased CO(2) production and improved aerobic stability of wheat, sorghum and maize silages. However, the combination of P. acidipropionici + L. plantarum did not improve aerobic stability of the silages.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The P. acidipropionici was very effective in protecting the wheat, sorghum and maize silages exposed to air under laboratory conditions, probably because the acidic environment under ensiling conditions is favourable for this micro-organism.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The use of P. acidipropionici, as a silage inoculant can improve the aerobic stability of silages by inhibition of yeast activity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Filya","given":"I"},{"family":"Sucu","given":"E"},{"family":"Karabulut","given":"a"}],"citation-key":"Filya2004","container-title":"Journal of applied microbiology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2672.2004.02367.x","ISSN":"1364-5072","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",1]]},"page":"818-26","PMID":"15357732","title":"The effect of Propionibacterium acidipropionici, with or without Lactobacillus plantarum, on the fermentation and aerobic stability of wheat, sorghum and maize silages.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15357732","volume":"97"},

  {"id":"Ford2001","abstract":"The objectives of this study were 1) to examine the interactive influence of a compensatory nutrition regimen and lasalocid supplementation on dairy heifer growth performance and 2) to document the extent to which compensatory growth sustains lactation potential over the first two lactation cycles. Twelve Holstein heifers, weighing an average of 160 kg (about 6 mo of age) were randomly assigned to treatments arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Treatment variables were two dietary regimens (control and stair-step compensatory nutrition) and two levels of lasalocid (0 and 200 mg/d). The control heifers were fed a diet containing 12% crude protein (CP) and 2.35 Mcal of metabolizable energy (ME) per kilogram of dry matter. The stair-step compensatory nutrition heifers were subjected to a phased nutrition regimen and reared according to an alternating 3-2-4-3-4-2-mo schedule. The first stair-step (prepubertal phase) consisted of energy restriction [17% CP and 2.35 Mcal/kg of ME] for 3 mo followed by realimentation (12% CP and 3.05 Mcal/kg of ME) for 2 mo. The second step (puberty and breeding) consisted of energy restriction for 4 mo followed by realimentation for 3 mo. The third step (gestation period) was energy restriction for 4 mo concluding with realimentation for 2 mo. Dry matter intake of heifers during the restriction phase was limited to 70% of the control intake. Heifers were given ad libitum access to a high energy density diet during realimentation to allow compensatory development. Stair-step heifers supplemented with lasalocid had the highest efficiency of growth (body weight gain/dry matter intake), suggesting synergistic metabolism of lasalocid with compensatory growth action. Compensatory growth induced during the last trimester enhanced metabolic status by increasing circulating insulin and decreasing triglyceride levels. Heifers on the stair-step regimen had a significant increase in milk yield during the first (21%) and second (15%) lactation cycles. These results support our thesis that compensatory growth induced during an allometric growth phase improves mammary development and energy and protein metabolic status of dairy heifers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Ford","given":"J","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Park","given":"C S"}],"citation-key":"Ford2001","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(01)74602-4","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",7]]},"page":"1669-78","PMID":"11467817","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Nutritionally directed compensatory growth enhances heifer development and lactation potential.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11467817","volume":"84"},

  {"id":"fournel2019","abstract":"Recent technological advances in the dairy industry have enabled Canadian farms with liquid manure systems to use mechanical solid-liquid separation paired with composting of the separated solids for on-farm production of low-cost bedding material. However, because several approaches are available, it is difficult for farmers to select the appropriate one to achieve high quality recycled manure solids (RMS). Whereas 3 solid-liquid manure separators were compared in part I of the series (companion paper in this issue), the present study (part II) aims to assess the performance of 4 composting methods (static or turned windrow and drum composter for 24 or 72 h) under laboratory conditions. Parameters evaluated included temperature, physico-chemical characteristics, and bacterial composition of RMS, as well as airborne microorganisms, dust, and gases associated with composting RMS. Because each treatment attained the desired composting temperature range of 40 to 65°C (either in heaps or in the drum composter), reductions in bacteria were a better indicator of the sanitation efficiency. The treatment of fresh RMS in a drum composter for 24 h showed decreased bacterial counts, especially for Escherichia coli (from 1.0 × 105 to 2.0 × 101 cfu/g of dry matter) and Klebsiella spp. (from 3.2 × 104 to 4.0 × 102 cfu/g of dry matter). Increasing the time spent in the rotating vessel to 72 h did not result in further decreases of these pathogens. Composting in a static or turned windrow achieved similar E. coli and Klebsiella spp. reductions as the 24-h drum composting but in 5 or 10 d, and generally showed the lowest occupational exposure risk for dairy farmers regarding concentrations of airborne mesophilic bacteria, mesophilic and thermotolerant fungi, and total dust. Drum-composted RMS stored in piles exhibited intermediate to high risk. Composting approaches did not have a major influence on the physico-chemical characteristics of RMS and gas emissions. Drum composting for 24 h was the best compromise in terms of product quality, temperature reached, decreased bacterial numbers, and emitted airborne contaminants. However, because levels of pathogenic agents rapidly increase once composted RMS are spread in stalls, bacteriological characteristics of RMS along with milk quality and animal health and welfare features should be monitored in Canadian dairy barns applying recommended separation (part I) and composting (part II) systems to evaluate health risk and optimize management practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Fournel","given":"S."},{"family":"Godbout","given":"S."},{"family":"Ruel","given":"P."},{"family":"Fortin","given":"A."},{"family":"Duquette-Lozeau","given":"K."},{"family":"Létourneau","given":"V."},{"family":"Généreux","given":"M."},{"family":"Lemieux","given":"J."},{"family":"Potvin","given":"D."},{"family":"Côté","given":"C."},{"family":"Duchaine","given":"C."},{"family":"Pellerin","given":"D."}],"citation-key":"fournel2019","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2018-14967","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1847-1865","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Production of recycled manure solids for use as bedding in Canadian dairy farms: II.

Blood samples were obtained from cows before vaccination and at weekly intervals until calving and from calves at birth and 24 h for analysis of serum protein concentrations, packed cell volume, white blood cell counts, white blood cell differentials, and serum rotavirus neutralization titers. Colostrum quantity and quality were measured at calving, and immunoglobulin isotype concentrations in colostrum were determined. Specific immunity was enhanced by MOS supplementation as evidenced by greater serum rotavirus neutralization titers at calving in cows sup-plemented with MOS compared with control cows. Co-lostral rotavirus neutralization titers were not affected by treatment. Although numerical differences appeared large, there was a high degree of variability in the colos-tral rotavirus neutralization titers. Calves from cows fed MOS tended to have greater serum rotavirus neu-tralization titers compared with calves from cows fed the control diet. There was a tendency for greater in-creases in serum protein concentrations from birth to 24 h in calves from cows fed MOS compared with calves from cows fed the control diet. Results indicate that supplementation of MOS to cows during the dry period enhanced their immune response to rotavirus and tended to enhance the subsequent transfer of rotavirus antibodies to calves.

We followed integument alterations, cleanliness of the animals and udder health fortnightly. With RMS bedding cows had less severe integument alterations in tarsal joints (p=0.0031) and their udders were cleaner (p=0.0109) compared to peat. Somatic cell count did not differ between bedding materials, but link between RMS bedding and the small number of cases of clinical mastitis cannot be ruled out.

  {"id":"Frutos2014","abstract":"Previous investigations have shown that cobalt (Co) modifies milk fat composition in cattle, consistent with an inhibition of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) activity, but it remains unclear whether other ruminant species are also affected. The present study examined the effects of oral administration of Co acetate on intake, rumen function, and milk production and fatty acid (FA) composition in sheep. Twenty lactating Assaf ewes were allocated into 1 of 4 groups and used in a continuous randomized block design that involved a 15-d adaptation, a 6-d treatment, and a 10-d posttreatment period. During the treatment period, animals received an oral drench supplying 0 (control), 3 (Co3), 6 (Co6), and 9 (Co9) mg of Co/kg of BW per day, administered in 3 equal doses at 8-h intervals. Cobalt acetate had no influence on intake or milk fat and protein concentrations, whereas treatments Co6 and Co9 tended to lower milk yield. Results on rumen parameters showed no effects on rumen fermentation, FA composition, or bacterial community structure. Administration of Co acetate decreased milk concentrations of FA containing a cis-9 double bond and SCD product:substrate ratios, consistent with an inhibition of SCD activity in the ovine mammary gland. Temporal changes in milk fat composition indicated that the effects of treatments were evident within 3d of dosing, with further changes being apparent after 6d and reverting to pretreatment values by d 6 after administration. Effect on milk FA composition did not differ substantially in response to incremental doses of Co acetate. On average, Co decreased milk cis-9 10:1/10:0, cis-9 12:1/12:0, cis-9 14:1/14:0, cis-9 16:1/16:0, cis-9 17:1/17:0, cis-9 18:1/18:0, and cis-9,trans-11 18:2/trans-11 18:1 concentration ratios by 30, 32, 38, 33, 21, 24, and 25%, respectively. Changes in milk fat cis-9 10:1, cis-9 12:1, and cis-9 14:1 concentrations to Co treatment indicated that 51% of cis-9 18:1 and cis-9,trans-11 18:2 secreted in milk originated from Δ(9)-desaturation. In conclusion, results demonstrated the potential of oral Co administration for the estimation of endogenous synthesis of FA containing a cis-9 double bond in the mammary gland of lactating ruminants. Indirect comparisons suggest that the effects of Co differ between sheep and cattle.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Frutos","given":"P"},{"family":"Toral","given":"P G"},{"family":"Ramos-Morales","given":"E"},{"family":"Shingfield","given":"K J"},{"family":"Belenguer","given":"a"},{"family":"Hervás","given":"G"}],"citation-key":"Frutos2014","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2013-7327","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3]]},"page":"1036-46","PMID":"24315322","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Oral administration of cobalt acetate alters milk fatty acid composition, consistent with an inhibition of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase in lactating ewes.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24315322","volume":"97"},

Accordingly, a study was conducted to evaluate the effects of BSFL as a protein supplement in beef steers. Six steers (603 ± 20 kg of BW, n = 3 and 404 ± 17 kg of BW, n = 3) consuming King Ranch bluestem hay (6.55% dry matter [DM] crude protein [CP]) ad libitum were used in two simultaneous 3 × 3 Latin squares. Steers were provided one of three treatments each period: 1) a control with no supplement (CON), 2) a supplement comprised of conventional feed ingredients with whole cottonseed and soybean meal as the main protein sources (CONV), and 3) a supplement with BSFL as the main protein source (BSFL). Three 14-d periods were conducted with 8 d to adapt to treatments, 5 d to measure intake and digestion, and 1 d to complete a ruminal fermentation profile. DM, organic matter (OM), CP, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent insoluble ash were determined in forage, supplement, ort, and fecal samples. Protein supplementation as CONV or BSFL stimulated forage OM intake (P ≤ 0.01) relative to CON with a trend for a difference (P = 0.08) between the supplements such that CONV steers consumed more FOMI than BSFL steers. Treatment affected total digestible OM intake (TDOMI; P ≤ 0.01); TDOMI for CON steers was 47.5 g/kg metabolic body weight (MBW) which was significantly less (P ≤ 0.01) than that of CONV or BSFL steers. Steers supplemented with CONV consumed significantly more TDOMI than BSFL steers (P = 0.05; 62.2 vs. 60.1 g/kg MBW, respectively). Treatment did not significantly affect digestibility of DM, OM, or NDF (P > 0.32). There was also not a significant effect (P ≥ 0.17) of treatment on ruminal ammonia-N, total volatile fatty acids, or ruminal pH. Overall, these data indicate that BSFL may be an effective protein supplement for beef cattle consuming low-quality forage.","author":[{"family":"Fukuda","given":"Emma P"},{"family":"Cox","given":"Jodi R"},{"family":"Wickersham","given":"Tryon A"},{"family":"Drewery","given":"Merritt L"}],"citation-key":"fukudaEvaluationBlackSoldier","DOI":"10.1093/tas/txac018","title":"Evaluation of Black Soldier Fly larvae (Hermetia illucens) as a protein supplement for beef steers consuming low-quality forage 1","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/tas/txac018"},

  {"id":"Gadeyne2017","abstract":"Polyunsaturated fatty acids given to ruminants are to a large extent hydrogenated to more saturated forms by microbial metabolism. Numerous protection technologies have been developed to overcome this hydrogenation process in order to increase the amount of unsaturated fatty acids bypassing the rumen and resulting in an effective transfer to the peripheral tissues. This review gives an overview of the current state of the art in rumen lipid bypass technologies, with the focus on both patent-described protection mechanisms, possible advantages or drawbacks of the technologies, and protection results being described in recent scientific literature. Lipid bypass techniques which are dealt with include calcium salts, fatty acyl amides, aldehyde treatment, non-enzymatic browning, lipid composite gels, and encapsulation within lipids. Further, the potential of a novel rumen lipid protection technology, based on interfacial cross-linking of emulsions, is explored. Therefore, an overview is given on current knowledge of different types of enzymatically induced cross-linking of protein at emulsion interfaces, both for existing food and possible ruminal bypass applications. Practical applications: Both from a human and animal health care as well as from a resource-saving and economic perspective, protection of PUFA from ruminal BH is of interest. Protection, release, and absorption principle of a lipophilic rumen bypass product: As polyunsaturated fatty acids (P) are hydrogenated to more saturated fatty acids (S) upon ruminal passage (panel A), P sources administered to ruminants have to be protected against microbial turnover to transfer them to the peripheral tissues (panel B).","author":[{"family":"Gadeyne","given":"Frederik"},{"family":"De Neve","given":"Nympha"},{"family":"Vlaeminck","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Fievez","given":"Veerle"}],"citation-key":"Gadeyne2017","container-title":"European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology","DOI":"10.1002/ejlt.201600345","ISSN":"14389312","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"1-22","title":"State of the art in rumen lipid protection technologies and emerging interfacial protein cross-linking methods","type":"article-journal","volume":"119"},

A total of 60 cows were divided into three groups (n = 20). Daily diet of cows was supplemented with 14 g of CLA (7 g cis-9, trans-11 and 7 g trans-10, cis-12 isomers) from week 3 before the expected date of calving (group CLA1), or from the day of calving (group CLA2) until 77-91 days PP. Control cows were fed an isocaloric, isonitrogenous and isolipidic diet without CLA. Between week 3 and week 6 PP, the milk yield of cows in both CLA-treated groups was approximately 4.5 kg higher (p < 0.05) than in control. Milk fat concentrations decreased from week 3 and were lower in both CLA groups than in control (p < 0.01). Body condition score loss was lower (p < 0.05) in the CLA1 than in the control group on week 5 PP. By week 11 PP, the body condition of both CLA1 and CLA2 groups exceeded that of control. Plasma non-esterified fatty acid was lower in CLA1 compared to CLA2 and control during the early PP period (p < 0.05), while this difference faded away by the late PP period. Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) increased rapidly in all groups following calving. In CLA1 group, it began to decrease sooner than in CLA2 and control. The prevalence of subclinical ketosis (BHBA > 1.2 mm) was lower in CLA1 group than in CLA2 and control (p < 0.05). Liver biopsy analyses showed that CLA1 treatment decreased (p < 0.05) the total lipid content of liver compared to control at week 5 after calving. Our results show that CLA supplementation is more efficient in alleviating body mass mobilization and decreasing the incidence of subclinical ketosis when applied as early as 3 weeks before calving than started feeding after calving.","author":[{"family":"Galamb","given":"E."},{"family":"Faigl","given":"V."},{"family":"Keresztes","given":"M."},{"family":"Csillik","given":"Z."},{"family":"Tröscher","given":"A."},{"family":"Elek","given":"P."},{"family":"Kulcsár","given":"M."},{"family":"Huszenicza","given":"G."},{"family":"Fébel","given":"H."},{"family":"Husvéth","given":"F."}],"citation-key":"Galamb2017","container-title":"Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition","DOI":"10.1111/jpn.12544","ISBN":"3614784207","ISSN":"14390396","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"1026-1035","title":"Effect of pre- and post-partum supplementation with lipid-encapsulated conjugated linoleic acid on milk yield and metabolic status in multiparous high-producing dairy cows","type":"article-journal","volume":"101"},

  {"id":"Gelsinger2016","abstract":"Several studies and a 2013 meta-analysis have proposed that increased feeding of milk or milk replacer to neonatal calves may improve subsequent milk production. However, data from individual studies are conflicting, and the meta-analysis was unable to assess the influence of calf starter intake. The objective of the current meta-analysis was to review newly published data and evaluate the effects of preweaning diet (including calf starter intake) and growth rate on first-lactation milk, fat, and protein yield. Data from 9 studies representing 21 treatment groups were included in the analysis. We created separate models for each outcome variable using regression methods in SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) to determine the effects of intake and growth rate. We then selected the best-fitting models using Akaike’s information criterion.

  {"id":"gelsinger2016","abstract":"Several studies and a 2013 meta-analysis have proposed that increased feeding of milk or milk replacer to neonatal calves may improve subsequent milk production. However, data from individual studies are conflicting, and the meta-analysis was unable to assess the influence of calf starter intake. The objective of the current meta-analysis was to review newly published data and evaluate the effects of preweaning diet (including calf starter intake) and growth rate on first-lactation milk, fat, and protein yield. Data from 9 studies representing 21 treatment groups were included in the analysis. We created separate models for each outcome variable using regression methods in SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) to determine the effects of intake and growth rate. We then selected the best-fitting models using Akaike’s information criterion.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The effectiveness of several premilking teat-cleaning regimes in reducing teat microbial load was assessed using 40 cows on each of the four commercial UK dairy farms with herringbone parlours during two sampling periods. In the first experiment, all the treatments reduced teat total viable count (TVC), but there was no significant difference between the hypochlorite wash and dry wipe, iodine dip and dry and alcohol-medicated wipe or dry wipe alone. In the second experiment, the chlorine wash and dry wipe was significantly more effective in reducing teat TVC than a water wash and dry, chlorine dip and dry or a dry wipe. There was no relationship between cleaning regime and milk TVC, Enterobacteriaceae or Escherichia coli levels. CONCLUSIONS: All of the cleaning techniques studied reduced teat microbial load, however, the chlorine wash and dry was the most effective. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The premilking teat-cleaning techniques studied reduced the teat microbial load and therefore reduced the potential for milk contamination; however, a wash including an effective disinfectant followed by a dry wipe was the most effective.","author":[{"family":"Gibson","given":"H."},{"family":"Sinclair","given":"L.

The teat preparations included 'Iodine', 'Chlorhexidine' teat foam, 'Washing and drying' with paper, 'No preparation', 'Chlorine' teat foam, and disinfectant 'Wipes'. Teat preparations were applied for five days to 10 cows for each treatment during two herd management periods (indoors and outdoors). Teats were swabbed on day four and five before teat preparation and repeated after teat preparation. The swabs were plated on three selective agars: Baird Parker (Staphylococcus spp.), Edwards (Streptococcus spp.), and MacConkey (coliform). Following incubation, microbial counts for each pathogen type were manually counted and assigned to one of six categories depending on the microbial counts measured. The results were analysed by logistic regression using SAS 28. The main analysis was conducted on binary improvement scores for the swabbing outcomes. There were no differences for staphylococcal, streptococcal and coliform bacterial counts between treatments, measured 'before' teat preparation. Treatments containing 'Chlorhexidine' teat foam (OR = 4.46) and 'Wipes' (OR = 4.46) resulted in a significant reduction (P < 0.01) in the staphylococcal count on teats compared to 'Washing and drying' or 'No preparation'. 'Chlorine' teat foam (OR = 3.45) and 'Wipes' (3.45) had the highest probability (P < 0.01) of reducing streptococcal counts compared to 'Washing and drying' or 'No preparation'. There was no statistical difference between any of the disinfectant treatments applied in reducing coliforms. Thus, the use of some disinfectant products for pre-milking teat preparation can have beneficial effects on reducing the levels of staphylococcal and streptococcal pathogens on teat skin.","author":[{"family":"Gleeson","given":"D"},{"family":"O'Brien","given":"B"},{"family":"Flynn","given":"J"},{"family":"O'Callaghan","given":"E"},{"family":"Galli","given":"F"}],"citation-key":"Gleeson2009","container-title":"Irish Veterinary Journal","DOI":"10.1186/2046-0481-62-7-461","ISSN":"2046-0481","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"page":"461","PMID":"21851738","title":"Effect of pre-milking teat preparation procedures on the microbial count on teats prior to cluster application","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://irishvetjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2046-0481-62-7-461","volume":"62"},

  {"id":"Goff1998","abstract":"Diets that contain high amounts of K induce milk fever by alkalinizing the blood of the cow, reducing the ability of homeostatic mechanisms to maintain normal blood concentrations of Ca. The addition of anions to the diet induces metabolic acidosis, which counteracts the alkalinizing effect of the high cation diets commonly fed to cows. Currently, anions are usually added as anionic salts, such as CaCl2 or MgSO4, and the pH of urine is often monitored to assess the degree of metabolic acidification resulting from the addition of anions to the diet. An alternative source of anions is HCl. In Experiment 1, the addition of HCl to the diet of cows that were not pregnant and not lactating significantly reduced the pH of urine and blood within 24 h. After HCl was removed from the diet, the pH of urine returned to baseline levels within 48 h. In Experiment 2, the inclusion of HCl into the prepartum ration of Jersey cows entering the third or greater lactation significantly reduced the incidence of milk fever from 63% of control cows to 11% of the treated cows and also reduced the degree of hypocalcemia that was experienced by the cows during the periparturient period. Plasma Ca concentrations at 0.5 d after calving were 5.33 +/- 0.52 and 6.69 +/- 0.51 mg/dl in the control and the HCl-treated cows, respectively. In Experiment 2, the prepartum consumption of the ration with HCl was greater than the consumption of the control ration. In liquid form, HCl remains dangerous to handle and corrosive to machinery. Commercial preparations of HCl mixed into common feed ingredients as a premix could offer an inexpensive and palatable alternative to anionic salts as a means of controlling the incidence of milk fever in dairy cows.","author":[{"family":"Goff","given":"J P"},{"family":"Horst","given":"R L"}],"citation-key":"Goff1998","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(98)75847-3","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",11]]},"page":"2874-80","PMID":"9839229","title":"Use of hydrochloric acid as a source of anions for prevention of milk fever.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9839229","volume":"81"},

  {"id":"goff2018","abstract":"Several minerals are required for life to exist. In animals, 7 elements (Ca, P, Mg, Na, K, Cl, and S) are required to be present in the diet in fairly large amounts (grams to tens of grams each day for the dairy cow) and are termed macrominerals. Several other elements are termed microminerals or trace minerals because they are required in much smaller amounts (milligrams to micrograms each day). In most cases the mineral in the diet must be absorbed across the gastrointestinal mucosa and enter the blood if it is to be of value to the animal. The bulk of this review discusses the paracellular and transcellular mechanisms used by the gastrointestinal tract to absorb each of the various minerals needed. Unfortunately, particularly in ruminants, interactions between minerals and other substances within the diet can occur within the digestive tract that impair mineral absorption. The attributes of organic or chelated minerals that might permit diet minerals to circumvent factors that inhibit absorption of more traditional inorganic forms of these minerals are discussed. Once absorbed, minerals are used in many ways. One focus of this review is the effect macrominerals have on the acid–base status of the animal. Manipulation of dietary cation and anion content is commonly used as a tool in the dry period and during lactation to improve performance. A section on how the strong ion theory can be used to understand these effects is included. Many microminerals play a role in the body as cofactors of enzymes involved in controlling free radicals within the body and are vital to antioxidant capabilities. Those same minerals, when consumed in excess, can become pro-oxidants in the body, generating destructive free radicals. Complex interactions between minerals can compromise the effectiveness of a diet in promoting health and productivity of the cow.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Goff","given":"Jesse P."}],"citation-key":"goff2018","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2017-13112","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4]]},"language":"en","page":"2763-2813","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Invited review: Mineral absorption mechanisms, mineral interactions that affect acid–base and antioxidant status, and diet considerations to improve mineral status","title-short":"Invited review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030218300614","volume":"101"},

Basal diets were formulated for 16.6% crude protein and 1.55 Mcal/kg of net energy for lactation and contained 35% of dietary dry matter as corn silage, 15% alfalfa hay, 34% of a concentrate mix containing varying proportions of ground shelled corn and soybean meal, and 16% of a constant concentrate premix. The premix consisted of equal proportions of corn distillers grains, soybean hulls, expeller soybean meal, vitamins, and minerals across all diets. Diets contained either no supplemental FS (NFS) or FS (8.64% RationMate) and either no SU (NSU) or SU (0.61% Ruma Pro) in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Feeding FS tended to decrease milk production compared with feeding NFS. Milk fat percentage was increased for cows fed FS compared with NFS. Feeding SU decreased dry matter intake and increased feed efficiency compared with cows fed NSU. Dietary treatment had no effect on energy-corrected milk, milk fat yield, milk protein percentage, or milk urea N. Feeding FS increased the molar proportion of ruminal butyrate and decreased the molar proportion of propionate; however, no other effects were observed on ruminal fermentation. No interactions between FS and SU were observed. It was concluded that the replacement of corn and soybean meal with dietary FS increased milk fat percentage and that the replacement of soybean meal with SU significantly improved feed efficiency.","author":[{"family":"Golombeski","given":"G L"},{"family":"Kalscheur","given":"K F"},{"family":"Hippen","given":"a R"},{"family":"Schingoethe","given":"D J"}],"citation-key":"Golombeski2006","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72486-9","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",11]]},"page":"4395-403","PMID":"17033027","title":"Slow-release urea and highly fermentable sugars in diets fed to lactating dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17033027","volume":"89"},
  {"id":"gomez2015","abstract":"The long-term effects of prepartum digital dermatitis (DD) on first-lactation performance were evaluated in a cohort of 719 pregnant heifers. All heifers were followed for a period of 6 mo until calving and classified on the basis of the number of DD events diagnosed during this period as type I, type II, or type III (no DD, one DD event, and multiple DD events, respectively). Health during the initial 60d in milk (DIM), reproductive and hoof health outcomes, and milk production were compared between the 3 heifer type groups. All logistic and linear models were adjusted for age, height, and girth circumference at enrollment, and the type of trace mineral supplementation during the prepartum period. Overall, cows experiencing DD during the rearing period showed worse production and health outcomes compared with healthy heifers during the first lactation. The percentages of assisted calvings, stillbirths, culled before 60 DIM, and diseased cows during the fresh period were numerically higher in type III cows compared with type I cows. However, none of these differences were statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Significantly lower conception at first service [odds ratio (OR)=0.55, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.33, 0.89] and increased number of days open (mean=24d, 95% CI: 5.2, 43) were observed in type III cows compared with type I cows. In relation to hoof health, a significantly increased risk of DD during the first lactation was found in type II and III cows (OR=5.16, 95% CI: 3.23, 8.29; and OR=12.5, 95% CI: 7.52, 21.1, respectively), as well as earlier occurrence of DD following calving (OR=59d, 95% CI=20, 96, and OR=74d, 95% CI: 37, 109). Compared with type I cows, statistically significant milk production losses during the initial 305 DIM of 199 and 335kg were estimated in type II and III cows, respectively. This difference was due to a greater rate of production decline (less persistence) after peak yield. No differences in monthly fat and protein percentages or somatic cell counts were observed between the heifer types. Given the long-term effects of DD on health, reproduction, and production, one of the priorities during the rearing period of dairy heifers should be efficient DD prevention and control programs. Such intensive intervention programs based on active long-term DD surveillance, mitigation of risk factors, and prompt treatment are expected to increase overall animal well-being and farm profitability by minimizing the effect of DD during the first lactation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Gomez","given":"A."},{"family":"Cook","given":"N.

  {"id":"Gordon1986","abstract":"Twenty-four lactating British Friesian cows were used in a four-period partially balanced change-over design experiment to evaluate eight treatments consisting of two silage types (wilted and unwilted), each offered in addition to supplements containing both two crude protein (CP) levels (160 and 210 g/kg fresh weight) and two energy levels (10·8 and 12·9 MJ metabolizable energy (ME) per kg fresh weight) obtained by including 100 g spray-dried tallow per kg, in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. All supplements were offered at ttie same rate of 6·8 kg/day and total diet digestibility and food utilization studies were carried out on all animals at the end of the final period of the experiment. A separate two-period change-over design expeximent, using two lactating cows fitted with rumen cannulae, was undertaken to determine the influence of the two silages on volatile fatty acid (VFA) proportions in the rumen and to measure the rates of disappearance of dry matter (DM) and nitrogen in the silages and supplements from the rumen.There were no significant interactions between silage and supplement type in terms of animal performance. Animals offered unwilted silage consumed proportionately 003 less DM but produced 0·03 more milk than those offered wilted silage. Although total diet digestibility was not influenced by silage type because of the higher gross energy concentration of the unwilted silage the ME intake with this diet was higher than with the diet based on wilted silage and the ratios of milk energy output to ME available for production (0·54) were similar with both silages. Silage type had no effect on the rumen VFA proportions but influenced the jates of disappearance of DM and nitrogen from the rumen.Increasing the CP concentratioryof the supplement had no effect on the intake of silage DM but resulted in a significant incrase in milk yield (0·55 kg/day) but due to a reduction in milk fat concentration there was np etfect on yield of either fat-corrected milk or milk energy. The use of the higher energy supplement depressed the intake of silage DM by 0·46 kg/day but resulted in an increase in milk yield of 0·74 kg/day. Neither CP nor energy concentration of the supplement had any effect on DM or energy digestibility of the total diet but there were considerable differences between supplements in the patterns of nitrogen and DM disappearance from the rumen.","author":[{"family":"Gordon","given":"F.

  {"id":"Gorka2018","abstract":"Promotion of microbial butyrate production in the reticulorumen is a widely used method for enhancing forestomach development in calves. Additional acceleration of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) development, both the forestomach and lower parts of the GIT (e.g., abomasum, intestine, and also pancreas), can be obtained by dietary butyrate supplementation. For this purpose, different sources (e.g., butyrate salts or butyrins), forms (e.g., protected or unprotected), methods (e.g., in liquid feed or solid feed), and periods (e.g., before or after weaning) of butyrate administration can be used. The aim of this paper was to summarize the knowledge in the field of butyrate supplementation in feeds for newborn calves in practical situations, and to suggest directions of future studies. It has been repeatedly shown that supplementation of unprotected salts of butyrate (primarily sodium salt) in milk replacer (MR) stimulates the rumen, small intestine, and pancreas development in calves, with a supplementation level equating to 0.3% of dry matter being sufficient to exert the desired effect on both GIT development and growth performance. On the other hand, the effect of unprotected butyrins and protected forms of butyrate supplementation in MR has not been extensively investigated, and few studies have documented the effect of butyrate addition into whole milk (WM), with those available focusing mainly on the growth performance of animals. Protected butyrate supplementation at a low level (0.3% of protected product in DM) in solid feed was shown to have a potential to enhance GIT development and performance of calves fed MR during the preweaning period. Justification of this form of butyrate supplementation in solid feed when calves are fed WM or after weaning needs to be documented. After weaning, inclusion of unprotected butyrate salts in solid feed was shown to increase solid feed intake, but the effect on GIT development and function has not been determined in detail, and optimal levels of supplementation are also difficult to recommend based on available reports. Future studies should focus on comparing different sources (e.g., salts vs. esters), forms (e.g., protected vs. unprotected), and doses of supplemental butyrate in liquid feeds and solid feeds and their effect not only on the development of rumen, abomasum, and small intestine but also the omasum and large intestine. Furthermore, the most effective source, form, and dose of supplemental butyrate in solid feed depending on the liquid feed program (e.g., MR or WM), stage of rearing (e.g., pre- or postweaning), and solid composition (e.g., lack or presence of forage in the diet) need to be determined.","author":[{"family":"Górka","given":"P."},{"family":"Kowalski","given":"Z.

  {"id":"Goselink2013","abstract":"We previously reported that supplementation of rumen-protected choline (RPC) reduces the hepatic triacylglycerol concentration in periparturient dairy cows during early lactation. Here, we investigated the effect of RPC on the transcript levels of lipid metabolism-related genes in liver and adipose tissue biopsies, taken at wk -3, 1, 3, and 6 after calving, to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this RPC-induced reduction of hepatic lipidosis. Sixteen multiparous cows were blocked into 8 pairs and randomly allocated to either 1 of 2 treatments, with or without RPC. Treatments were applied from 3wk before to 6wk after calving. Both groups received a basal diet and concentrate mixture. One group received RPC supplementation, resulting in an intake of 14.4g of choline per day, whereas controls received an isoenergetic mixture of palm oil and additional soybean meal. Liver and adipose tissue biopsies were taken at wk -3, 1, 3, and 6 to determine the mRNA abundance of 18 key genes involved in liver and adipose tissue lipid and energy metabolism. Milk samples were collected in wk 1, 2, 3, and 6 postpartum for analysis of milk fatty acid (FA) composition. The RPC-induced reduction in hepatic lipidosis could not be attributed to altered lipolysis in adipose tissue, as no treatment effect was observed on the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, lipoprotein lipase, or FA synthase in adipose tissue, or on the milk FA composition. Rumen-protected choline supplementation increased the expression of FA transport protein 5 and carnitine transporter SLC22A5 in the liver, suggesting an increase in the capacity of FA uptake and intracellular transport, but no treatment effect was observed on carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A, transporting long-chain FA into mitochondria. In the same organ, RPC appeared to promote apolipoprotein B-containing lipoprotein assembly, as shown by elevated microsomal triglyceride transfer protein expression and apolipoprotein B100 expression. Cows supplemented with RPC displayed elevated levels of glucose transporter 2 mRNA and a reduced peak in pyruvate carboxylase mRNA immediately after calving, showing that supplementation also resulted in improved carbohydrate metabolism. The results from this study suggest that RPC supplementation reduces liver triacylglycerol by improved FA processing and very-low-density lipoprotein synthesis, and RPC also benefits hepatic carbohydrate metabolism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Goselink","given":"R M","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Baal","given":"J","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Widjaja","given":"H C","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Dekker","given":"R","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Zom","given":"R L G"},{"family":"Veth","given":"M J","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Vuuren","given":"a M","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"Goselink2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5396","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",2]]},"page":"1102-16","PMID":"23200476","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of rumen-protected choline supplementation on liver and adipose gene expression during the transition period in dairy cattle.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23200476","volume":"96"},

Two measures of cellulose crystallinity calculated from the X-ray diffraction pattern indicated that treatment of barley straw with 30 g NH3 kg-1 straw produced a reduction in crystallinity index values of 14-24%.  The water retention of ammonia-treated barley straw was approximate 25% greater than that of the untreated straw following centrifugation at 300 g and 3000 g.  A slightly higher swollen volume was also observed for water-saturated ammonia-treated barley straw, although the difference was not significant.

  {"id":"gouveia2024","abstract":"Periparturient dairy cattle undergo physiological adaptations to support fetal growth and colostrum synthesis in late gestation and milk production in early lactation. To support energy and protein demands, dairy cattle mobilize body tissue reserves. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of prepartum skeletal muscle reserves and supplementation of branched-chain volatile fatty acids (BCVFA) on body composition measurements, metabolic markers related to health, protein, and energy status, and subsequent milk yield in multiparous dairy cows. Skeletal muscle reserves were assessed by 3 ultrasounds of the longissimus dorsi muscle depth (LDD) measured 42 d before expected calving, and cows (n = 48) were assigned to either high muscle (HM; >4.6 cm) or low muscle (LM; ≤4.6 cm) groups. Cows were then randomly assigned to either control (CON) of soyhull pellets (80 g/d) or BCVFA treatment, which contained isobutyrate (40 g/d), isovalerate (20 g/d), and 2-methylbutyrate (20 g/d) calcium salt products. Treatments were top dressed from 42 d before expected calving until parturition, resulting in 4 combinations of muscle groups and treatments: HM-CON (n = 13), HM-BCVFA (n = 13), LM-CON (n = 11), and LM-BCVFA (n = 11). Measurements of the LDD, BW, and BCS were taken on the following days relative to calving: −42, −35, −21, −7, 0, 7, 14, 21, 28. Weekly blood samples were taken to measure glucose, BHB, and insulin concentrations, and 5 of the blood sample time points were used to determine 3-methylhistidine and creatinine blood concentrations. Milk yield was recorded daily for the first 28 d of lactation, and samples were taken from both milkings once a week for the first 4 wk to determine components. The statistical model included the fixed effects of treatment, group, time, and their interactions, and the random effect of cow nested within group and treatment. Prepartum muscle mobilization varied between muscle groups, as LM cows accreted muscle prepartum, and HM cows mobilized muscle. The HM cows had higher milk fat, protein, lactose, and energy-corrected milk yields. The BCVFA supplementation tended to increase blood glucose concentrations both prepartum and postpartum and decreased milk urea nitrogen concentrations. Greater prepartum skeletal muscle reserves improve productivity of early-lactation cows, likely due to differences in muscle mobilization, and BCVFA supplementation improves glucose dynamics during the transition period, which may improve the metabolic health of the periparturient dairy cow.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Gouveia","given":"K.

  {"id":"Grant1999","abstract":"The Bottom Line: What is the Correct Particle Size for Your Farm? The proper corn grain particle size for your dairy will depend on the following factors: 1. Type of forage fed. As corn silage increases, silage moisture increases, or as particle length decreases, the particle size of the corn grain should increase. 2. Forage particle length. You should have 8 percent to 10 percent of total mixed ration particles on the top box of the Penn State Particle Separator®. These particles are greater than 3/4 inch and ensure proper rumination and rumen mat formation. 3. Amount of dietary nonfiber carbohydrate (NFC). If the NFC content of the diet is over 40 percent of the dry matter, then particle size of corn grain needs to be increased. Any time the diet exceeds 40 percent NFC, the risk of acidosis will increase. 4. Method of feeding the grain. A total mixed ration will allow a much wider range of grain particle size to be fed. The bottom line is that there are no single particle size guidelines that will fit every situation; however, the guidelines in Tables I and II should help you get started.

A subset of cows (n=9/diet) in CON (1.34 Mcal/kg of dry matter) and OVE (1.62 Mcal/kg of dry matter) received an intramammary LPS challenge (200 μg; CON-LPS, OVE-LPS, respectively). Liver biopsies were harvested at -14 d from calving, and postpartum at 2.5h post-LPS on d 7, 14, and 30. Prepartum, the OVE group was in more positive energy balance (EB) and had greater body condition score compared with CON. In contrast, during wk 1 postpartum and before the LPS challenge, the OVE group was in greater negative EB than CON. Prepartal diet did not affect postpartal milk production or dry matter intake. At 2h postchallenge on d 7, we observed an increase in serum nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and bilirubin and a decrease in hydroxybutyrate, regardless of diet. That was coupled with greater haptoglobin in OVE-LPS compared with CON-LPS. In addition, OVE-LPS cows versus CON nonchallenged, OVE nonchallenged, and CON-LPS had greater liver triacylglycerol (TAG) concentration 2.5h postchallenge on d 7. The concentration of TAG in liver of OVE-LPS remained elevated by 30d postpartum. The liver TAG concentration in OVE-LPS compared with CON-LPS cows was associated with greater serum concentration of NEFA and reactive oxygen metabolites on d 10 and 14 postpartum. Cows in OVE-LPS also had greater concentrations of ceruloplasmin, cholesterol, and vitamin E from d 10 through 21. Among 28 genes associated with fatty acid oxidation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and gluconeogenesis, only SAA3 (which encodes an acute phase protein) was greater in CON-LPS compared with OVE-LPS at 2.5h postchallenge. Expression of HP, which encodes another acute phase protein, was greater in OVE-LPS than in CON-LPS at 14 and 30 d postpartum. Several inflammation-related genes (TNF, IRAK1, NFKB1, ANGPTL4) showed markedly decreased expression between 7 and 14 d, after which expression remained unchanged. No differences were observed in several genes of the growth-hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis, except for SOCS2, expression of which decreased markedly between 7 and 14 d in OVE-LPS but not in CON-LPS. These data suggest that overfeeding a moderate-energy diet prepartum alters the response of the cow to an intramammary challenge after calving and may predispose it to sustained liver lipidosis.","author":[{"family":"Graugnard","given":"D.E."},{"family":"Moyes","given":"K.M."},{"family":"Trevisi","given":"E."},{"family":"Khan","given":"M.J."},{"family":"Keisler","given":"D."},{"family":"Drackley","given":"J.K."},{"family":"Bertoni","given":"G."},{"family":"Loor","given":"J.J."}],"citation-key":"Graugnard2013","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5676","ISBN":"1525-3198 (Electronic)\\r0022-0302 (Linking)","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"918-935","PMID":"23261380","title":"Liver lipid content and inflammometabolic indices in peripartal dairy cows are altered in response to prepartal energy intake and postpartal intramammary inflammatory challenge1","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030212009150","volume":"96"},

  {"id":"Greco2014","abstract":"The study was designed to evaluate the effects of altering the ratio between n-6 and n-3 fatty acids (FA) in the diet and the intake of these FA by lactating dairy cows on lactation performance and inflammatory acute phase responses to a challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Multiparous Holstein cows (n=45) were blocked based on milk yield from d 6 to d 10 postpartum and, within each block, assigned randomly to 1 of 3 dietary treatments at 14d postpartum; treatments lasted for 90d. Diets were supplemented with a mixture of Ca salts of fish, safflower, and palm oils to create 3 different ratios of n-6 to n-3 FA; namely, 3.9, 4.9, or 5.9 parts of n-6 to 1 part of n-3 FA (R4, R5, and R6, respectively). During the first 5 wk of the study, blood was sampled weekly and analyzed for concentrations of metabolites and hormones. On d 75 postpartum, cows received an infusion of 10µg of LPS into one quarter of the mammary gland to evaluate inflammatory acute phase responses. Altering the ratio of dietary n-6 to n-3 FA was reflected in changes in the FA composition of plasma and milk fat. Reducing the ratio of n-6 to n-3 FA from R6 to R4 increased dry matter intake (24.7, 24.6, and 26.1±0.5kg/d for R6, R5, and R4, respectively), with concurrent increases in yields of 3.5% fat-corrected milk (43.4, 45.4, and 48.0±0.8kg/d), milk fat (1.53, 1.60, and 1.71±0.03kg/d), milk true protein (1.24, 1.28, and 1.32±0.02kg/d), and milk lactose (2.12, 2.19, and 2.29±0.04kg/d). After the LPS challenge, concentrations of IL-6 in plasma increased as the ratio of n-6 to n-3 FA increased (112.5, 353.4, and 365.1±86.6pg/mL for R4, R5, and R6, respectively). Elevations of body temperature and somatic cell count were greater for cows fed R5 compared with those fed R4 or R6 (41.3, 40.8, and 40.8±0.2°C; 4.33, 3.68, and 3.58±0.25×10(6)/mL, for R5, R4, and R6, respectively). Haptoglobin concentration was greatest at 24h after LPS challenge for cows fed R6. Phagocytosis and oxidative burst by neutrophils collected from circulation were unaffected by dietary treatment in the first 48h after intramammary LPS infusion. In conclusion, supplying the same quantity of FA in the diet of early lactation dairy cows but altering the ratio of the polyunsaturated FA of the n-6 to n-3 families influenced lactation performance and inflammatory responses to an LPS challenge.","author":[{"family":"Greco","given":"L.F."},{"family":"Neto","given":"J.T.Neves"},{"family":"Pedrico","given":"A."},{"family":"Ferrazza","given":"R.A."},{"family":"Lima","given":"F.S."},{"family":"Bisinotto","given":"R.S."},{"family":"Martinez","given":"N."},{"family":"Garcia","given":"M."},{"family":"Ribeiro","given":"E.S."},{"family":"Gomes","given":"G.C."},{"family":"Shin","given":"J.H."},{"family":"Ballou","given":"M.A."},{"family":"Thatcher","given":"W.W."},{"family":"Staples","given":"C.R."},{"family":"Santos","given":"J.E.P."}],"citation-key":"Greco2014","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2014-8805","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"602-617","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effects of altering the ratio of dietary n-6 to n-3 fatty acids on performance and inflammatory responses to a lipopolysaccharide challenge in lactating Holstein cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2014-8805","volume":"98"},
  {"id":"Green2010","abstract":"Cattle that are not pregnant to first fixed-time artificial insemination (TAI) may be resynchronized for a second TAI if they are found nonpregnant at pregnancy diagnosis. The specific interval between first and second TAI ranges from 4 to 8 wk. The selected interval depends on the available method of pregnancy diagnosis and the efficiency of the resynchronization program. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate a pregnancy diagnosis and resynchronization system that achieved a 21-d interval between TAI. This 21-d interval approximates the natural return-to-service interval. It also enables resynchronization to be implemented within the same estrous cycle in which cattle are first inseminated. Holstein heifers were randomly assigned to a 21-d resynchronization program (21d_resynch; n = 40) or a control group in which estrus was observed for the purpose of re-insemination (control; n = 29). The 21d_resynch heifers were diagnosed for pregnancy on d 18 after a TAI (d 0) by using predetermined cut-off values for 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (Oas1) gene expression in leukocytes and plasma progesterone concentration. Heifers that were not pregnant to first TAI had greater expression of Oas1 at the time of PGF(2α) (d -3) than pregnant heifers, but this relationship was reversed on d 18 after TAI: the heifers that were pregnant to first TAI had almost 5-fold greater expression of Oas1 compared with nonpregnant heifers. Nonpregnant heifers in the 21d_resynch group were injected with a luteolytic dose of PGF(2α) on d 19 and were injected with GnRH on d 21 and submitted to TAI. The pregnancy per AI after first insemination was similar for 21d_resynch (50.0%; pregnancy diagnosis on d 18) and control (51.7%; pregnancy diagnosis on d 27). Likewise, no difference was detected in second insemination pregnancy per AI for 21d_resynch (36.8%; nonpregnant heifers TAI on d 21) and control (35.7%; nonpregnant heifers inseminated at return to estrus or after nonpregnant diagnosis on d 27). The interval between first and second insemination was shorter for 21d_resynch compared with control (21.0 ± 0 and 27.5 ± 2.1 d). The conclusion is that a TAI resynchronization can be programmed within 21 d of previous TAI when a d 18 pregnancy test and a rapid resynchronization are used.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Green","given":"J C"},{"family":"Okamura","given":"C S"},{"family":"Mathew","given":"D J"},{"family":"Newsom","given":"E M"},{"family":"Lucy","given":"M C"}],"citation-key":"Green2010","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2010-3395","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",12]]},"page":"5668-72","PMID":"21094738","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Hot topic: Successful fixed-time insemination within 21 d after first insemination by combining chemical pregnancy diagnosis on d 18 with a rapid resynchronization program.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21094738","volume":"93"},
  {"id":"Greenfield2000","abstract":"Feeding strategies of transition dairy cows contribute to the risk factors associated with metabolic disorders that limit production in the ensuing lactation. To investigate the effects of prepartum dietary crude protein (CP) concentration and amount of rumen-undegradable protein (RUP) on postpartum health and production, 44 multiparous Holstein cows were blocked by expected calving date and assigned to one of four isoenergetic prepartum rations beginning 28 d prior to expected calving date. Prepartum rations were: 12% CP and 26% RUP, 16% CP and 26% RUP, 16% CP and 33% RUP, or 16% CP and 40% RUP on a dry matter basis. All cows were fed the same postpartum diet (18% CP, 40% RUP) from 1 to 56 d in milk (DIM). Prepartum dry matter intake (DMI) was not different among dietary treatments. Mean postpartum intakes (kg/d) were higher through 56 DIM (P<0.05) for cows fed the 12% CP:26% RUP diet prepartum compared with any of the 16% CP diets (21.8 vs. 19.8, 18.6 and 18.6; 12% CP:26% RUP vs. 16% CP:26% RUP, 16% CP:33% RUP and 16% CP:40% RUP). There was a DIM x prepartum diet interaction (P<0.05) with the greatest effect of the 12% CP:26% RUP diet evident during the first 35 DIM. Cows fed the 12% CP:26% diet during the transition period tended to produce more milk (kg/d) (P = 0.08) than did cows fed any of the 16% CP diets (40.8 versus 37.8, 38.7, and 37.4; 12% CP:26% RUP vs. 16% CP:26% RUP, 16% CP:33% RUP, and 16% CP:40% RUP). Additional protein (12 vs. 16% CP) in the prepartum diet tended to decrease milk protein (P = 0.10) and milk fat yield (P = 0.08) but did not alter percent milk fat, percent milk protein, or MUN. Liver triglyceride (TG) expressed as milligrams of TG per microgram of DNA or percentage of dry matter (DM) on d -28, -14, +1, +28, and +56 relative to calving were not significantly different among treatments. Maximal (P<0.05) infiltration of TG in liver was observed on +1 d when expressed as a percentage of DM and on +28 d when expressed as milligrams of TG per microgram of DNA. Plasma glucose, calcium, urea nitrogen, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and nonesterified fatty acids were not different (P<0.05) among treatments. The data indicate carryover effects of prepartum dietary protein on postpartum intake and milk production, pointing to beneficial effects of maintaining dietary protein for dairy cows in late gestation at 12% CP.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Greenfield","given":"R B"},{"family":"Cecava","given":"M J"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"T R"},{"family":"Donkin","given":"S S"}],"citation-key":"Greenfield2000","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(00)74932-0","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",4]]},"page":"703-10","PMID":"10791786","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Impact of dietary protein amount and rumen undegradability on intake, peripartum liver triglyceride, plasma metabolites, and milk production in transition dairy cattle.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10791786","volume":"83"},

  {"id":"Gressley2011","abstract":"Microbial fermentation of carbohydrates in the hindgut of dairy cattle is responsible for 5 to 10% of total-tract carbohydrate digestion. When dietary, animal, or environmental factors contribute to abnormal, excessive flow of fermentable carbohydrates from the small intestine, hindgut acidosis can occur. Hindgut acidosis is characterized by increased rates of production of short-chain fatty acids including lactic acid, decreased digesta pH, and damage to gut epithelium as evidenced by the appearance of mucin casts in feces. Hindgut acidosis is more likely to occur in high-producing animals fed diets with relatively greater proportions of grains and lesser proportions of forage. In these animals, ruminal acidosis and poor selective retention of fermentable carbohydrates by the rumen will increase carbohydrate flow to the hindgut. In more severe situations, hindgut acidosis is characterized by an inflammatory response; the resulting breach of the barrier between animal and digesta may contribute to laminitis and other disorders. In a research setting, effects of increased hindgut fermentation have been evaluated using pulse-dose or continuous abomasal infusions of varying amounts of fermentable carbohydrates. Continuous small-dose abomasal infusions of 1 kg/d of pectin or fructans into lactating cows resulted in decreased diet digestibility and decreased milk fat percentage without affecting fecal pH or VFA concentrations. The decreased diet digestibility likely resulted from increased bulk in the digestive tract or from increased digesta passage rate, reducing exposure of the digesta to intestinal enzymes and epithelial absorptive surfaces. The same mechanism is proposed to explain the decreased milk fat percentage because only milk concentrations of long-chain fatty acids were decreased. Pulse-dose abomasal fructan infusions (1 g/kg of BW) into steers resulted in watery feces, decreased fecal pH, and increased fecal VFA concentrations, without causing an inflammatory response. Daily 12-h abomasal infusions of a large dose of starch (~4 kg/d) have also induced hindgut acidosis as indicated by decreased fecal pH and watery feces. On the farm, watery or foamy feces or presence of mucin casts in feces may indicate hindgut acidosis. In summary, hindgut acidosis occurs because of relatively high rates of large intestinal fermentation, likely due to digestive dysfunction in other parts of the gut. A better understanding of the relationship of this disorder to other animal health disorders is needed.","author":[{"family":"Gressley","given":"T. F."},{"family":"Hall","given":"M.

  {"id":"Grings1991","abstract":"The effect of increasing CP levels by additions of cottonseed meal to diets for early lactation was studied in 24 multiparous Holstein cows. Diets containing 13.8, 17.5, 20.4, and 23.9% CP were fed during three 3-wk periods beginning at wk 4 postpartum. Each cow received three of the four dietary treatments giving 18 observations per treatment in a randomized complete block design. Undegraded intake protein as a fraction of total protein for the diets was .25, .32, .36, and .39. Dry matter intake increased linearly with increasing dietary CP concentrations. Daily milk yield increased as dietary CP increased from 13.8 to 17.5%. Increased milk yield was accompanied by increased daily yields of milk fat and protein, but the concentration of these components in milk was not altered. The proportion of total milk N that was NPN increased linearly with increasing dietary CP level. Plasma amino acids and urea N were increased by increasing the dietary CP level. The conclusions of the study were that increasing dietary CP levels from 13.8 to 17.5% by the use of cottonseed meal was beneficial to cows consuming alfalfa-based diets in early lactation. Increasing dietary CP above 17.5% showed little benefit in milk yield. Increasing dietary protein caused an increase in blood urea N and milk NPN, indicating N wastage by the animal.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Grings","given":"E E"},{"family":"Roffler","given":"R E"},{"family":"Deitelhoff","given":"D P"}],"citation-key":"Grings1991","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(91)78436-1","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["1991",8]]},"page":"2580-7","PMID":"1655842","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Response of dairy cows in early lactation to additions of cottonseed meal in alfalfa-based diets.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1655842","volume":"74"},
  {"id":"Grohn2000","abstract":"The objectives of this presentation are to review results of our previous and on-going research with respect to the risk factors and consequences of poor reproductive performance in dairy cows, and to develop an economic framework to optimize decisions related to dairy cow reproductive performance. To make profitable breeding and replacement decisions, the farmer must account for factors including age, production level, lactation stage, pregnancy status, and disease history of the cows in the herd. Establishing the interrelationships among disease, milk yield, reproduction, and herd management is necessary for developing a decision model for disease treatment, insemination, and replacement. The data for the studies reviewed in this presentation incorporate health, production, and management components from Holsteins in the Northeast USA and Ayrshires from Finland. Data were analyzed using the Cornell Theory Center Supercomputer. The effect of risk factors on reproductive disorders was modeled with logistic regression, and on conception, insemination, and culling with survival analysis. The effect of reproductive disorders on milk yield was analyzed with mixed models. Economic optimization of reproductive performance was done with dynamic programming (DP). High milk yield, high parity, and calving in winter were risk factors for several reproductive disorders. These disorders, in turn, delayed insemination and conception in dairy cows, and some of them increased the risk of culling. Dystocia, retained placenta, and early metritis led to a short-term drop in milk production. High milk yield was not a major factor in delaying conception, except in first parity cows. However, higher yielders were more likely to be inseminated, and less likely to be culled. Non-pregnant cows had a higher risk of being culled. Reproductive performance of dairy cows influenced a herd's profitability, and good heat detection and conception rates provided opportunities for management control. It was not always economically advantageous to get cows pregnant as soon as possible, and there was no one optimal value for the calving interval length for all cows in a herd.","author":[{"family":"Gröhn","given":"Y T"},{"family":"Rajala-Schultz","given":"P J"}],"citation-key":"Grohn2000","container-title":"Animal Reproduction Science","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]},"page":"605-614","PMID":"10844228","publisher":"Section of Epidemiology, Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.","title":"Epidemiology of reproductive performance in dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10844228","volume":"60-61"},

  {"id":"groseth2025","abstract":"Studies have shown that extended wilting of grass before ensiling can improve the metabolizable protein (MP) value of the grass silage, both from increased rumen microbial crude protein (MCP) yield and ruminally undegraded crude protein (RUP). We hypothesised that extending the wilting of grass before ensiling can increase milk and milk protein production in dairy cows. Consequently, increased silage MP can reduce the need for MP in concentrate, estimated as amino acids absorbed in the small intestine (AAT20). To test this, a continuous feeding experiment was conducted, with 48 early- to mid-lactation Norwegian Red dairy cows. Treatments were 2 wilting levels of grass silages: 260 vs. 417 g dry matter (DM) per kg, and 2 qualities of concentrates differing in MP, in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement (n = 12). The concentrates were low MP (LMP); 104 g AAT20/kg DM, and high MP (HMP); 123 g AAT20/kg DM, supplied at 8.75 kg DM/cow per day. The cows had ad libitum access to the grass silages. The experiment lasted for 11 weeks. The first 2 weeks, where cows received identical diets, were used as the covariate period. Those data together with data collected the last 4 weeks were used for statistical evaluation of treatments. Increasing DM concentration in silage reduced lactic acid, ammonia nitrogen and proportion of methionine in the grass silage, while it increased residual water-soluble carbohydrates, pH, proportion of aspartic acid and rumen degradability of NDF. There was no difference between treatments in daily silage DM intake (13.1 kg), milk yield (30.2 kg) or milk composition. However, feeding HMP increased urea and uric acid in urine, and urea in blood plasma, thereby reduced N efficiency. No major differences were found for rumen pH, or purine derivatives to creatinine index in urine, as indication for MCP. There was significantly more histidine in blood plasma when cows were fed HMP concentrate. In conclusion, increased DM concentration in silage and HMP concentrate did not increase milk production or milk protein yield in this study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Grøseth","given":"M."},{"family":"Karlsson","given":"L."},{"family":"Steinshamn","given":"H."},{"family":"Johansen","given":"M."},{"family":"Kidane","given":"A."},{"family":"Prestløkken","given":"E."}],"citation-key":"groseth2025","container-title":"Livestock Science","container-title-short":"Livestock Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.livsci.2024.105611","ISSN":"1871-1413","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,1]]},"page":"105611","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Effects of dry matter concentration in grass silage on milk production of dairy cows fed concentrates high or low in metabolizable protein concentration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871141324002178","volume":"291"},
  {"id":"Grossi2013","abstract":"This study investigated the effects of the administration of long chain omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3 FA) and acetylsalicylic acid on inflammation, performance and fertility in periparturient dairy cows. Five weeks before calving 26 multiparous dairy cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: ω-3 FA (n=9; OM), ω-3 FA and acetylsalicylic acid (n=9; OMAS), or palm oil (n=8; CTR). During the last 3 weeks of pregnancy OM and OMAS groups received daily 12.0 g of fish-derived ω-3 FA, whereas CTR cows received only saturated fatty acids. In addition, OMAS cows received daily 6.0 mg acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)/kg BW starting at 7 d before calving. Only a few cows had health problems after calving, but those in OMAS were most affected (n=3 vs 1 in CTR). Inflammatory status around calving did not improve in OM cows, as confirmed by the patterns of concentration of acute-phase proteins (APP) which were similar to CTR. Compared with CTR and OM, the increase of the positive APP and the decrease of the negative APP (e.g. albumin; P<0.01) observed in OMAS cows suggested a severe inflammatory status after calving. Compared with OMAS, post-calving energy metabolism was better in OM cows as shown by a lower degree of lipomobilization (smaller BCS drop, higher glucose) and milder ketogenesis (lower β-hydroxybutyrate; P<0.01). Cows in CTR had optimal fertility indices, whereas OMAS was the worst group. The severe inflammation and the more negative energy balance likely contributed to the poor fertility parameters in those cows. It is known that ASA exerts an inhibitory effect on cyclooxygenases, causing a possible decrease in the synthesis of PGF2α. A lower level of PGF2α is connected with alterations in the physiologic processes related to labor and to uterine motility. Cows in OMAS had a longer pregnancy (P<0.10 vs OM) and a higher frequency of retained placenta, which may be attributed to lower synthesis of PGF2α. The administration of ω-3 FA alone did not delay calving or the expulsion of fetal membranes. In conclusion, long-chain ω-3 FA improved the physiological status of cows, partly through better energy balance. The administration of ASA before calving (even at a low dose) in combination with ω-3 FA did not exert any synergistic positive effect on inflammation and performance.","author":[{"family":"Grossi","given":"P."},{"family":"Bertoni","given":"G."},{"family":"Piccioli Cappelli","given":"F."},{"family":"Trevisi","given":"E."}],"citation-key":"Grossi2013","container-title":"Journal of Animal Science","DOI":"10.2527/jas.2012-5661","ISSN":"00218812","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"2657-2666","title":"Effects of the precalving administration of omega-3 fatty acids alone or in combination with acetylsalicylic acid in periparturient dairy cows","type":"article-journal","volume":"91"},

Dry matter intake was reduced by infusion of soy lecithin as compared with infusion of water (18.1 and 21.1 kg/d, respectively). Plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration was increased when cows received the myo-inositol or soy lecithin infusion, and plasma glucose was lower when cows received the choline or soy lecithin treatment. Infusion of soy lecithin caused approximately a twofold increase in plasma triglyceride-rich lipoprotein concentration. Milk fat percentage and milk fat yield were greater during soy lecithin infusion (3.54%, 1.11 kg/d) than during water (3.09%, .98 kg/d) or soy oil (3.06%, .98 kg/d) infusion.

It appears that APPs represent appropriate analytes for assessment of animal health. Whereas they represent non-specific markers as biological effect reactants, they can be used for assessing nutritional deficits and reactive processes, especially when positive and negative acute phase variables are combined in an index. When such acute phase index is applied to separate healthy animals from animals with some disease, much better results are obtained than with single analytes and statistically acceptable results for culling individual animals may be reached. Unfortunately at present no cheap, comprehensive and easy to use system is available for assessing various acute phase proteins in serum or blood samples at the same time. Protein microarray or fluid phase microchip technology may satisfy this need; and permit simultaneous analysis of numerous analytes in the same small volume sample and enable integration of information derived from systemic reactivity and nutrition with disease specific variables. Applying such technology may help to solve health problems in various countries not only in animal husbandry but also in human populations.","author":[{"family":"Gruys","given":"E."},{"family":"Toussaint","given":"M.J.M."},{"family":"Niewold","given":"T.A."},{"family":"Koopmans","given":"S.J."}],"citation-key":"Gruys2005","container-title":"Journal of Zhejiang University SCIENCE","DOI":"10.1631/jzus.2005.B1045","ISBN":"1673-1581 (Print)","ISSN":"1009-3095","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"page":"1045-1056","PMID":"16252337","title":"Acute phase reaction and acute phase proteins","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.zju.edu.cn/jzus/article.php?doi=10.1631/jzus.2005.B1045","volume":"6B"},
  {"id":"guadagninEffectFeedingRumenprotected2022","abstract":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2><p>Feeding rumen-protected methionine as an indispensable amino acid source has been shown to improve reproductive performance in dairy cows, but the effect of feeding rumen-protected lysine (RPL) during the peripartum period on reproductive performance is not well explored. Therefore, we aimed to determine the effects of feeding RPL (AjiPro-L Generation 3, Ajinomoto Heartland Inc.) prepartum, postpartum, or both on follicular dynamics, uterine health, and mRNA gene expression of the endometrium. Seventy-five multiparous Holstein cows were assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments with or without RPL in a randomized, complete block design. A 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments was used. Prepartum (–28 d to calving), animals were fed a diet (68% of dietary DM from forage) with RPL [PRE-L; 0.54% RPL of dietary dry matter intake] or without RPL (PRE-C). After calving, half of the cows from each prepartum treatment group were assigned to a diet (56% forage) with RPL (PRE-L POST-L; PRE-C POST-L; 0.40% RPL of dietary dry matter intake) or without RPL (PRE-C POST-C; PRE-L POST-C) until 28 d in milk (DIM). Vaginal discharge was detected with a Metricheck device (Simcro) to detect metritis, and at 28 DIM polymorphonuclear leukocytes were evaluated as a percentage of the epithelial cells using a cytology brush (Andwin Scientific) and an endometrial tissue biopsy was collected for mRNA expression and histology. The first postpartum follicular growth cycle was monitored at 7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, and 28 DIM via transrectal ultrasonography. Time to first ovulation did not differ between treatments and averaged 18 ± 1.6 DIM. Follicular diameter at first ovulation was not affected by the treatments, but the growth rate of dominant follicle before first ovulation tended to be lower for cows in POST-L in comparison with cows in POST-C. Prevalence of fetid vaginal discharge and metritis did not differ between treatments. Cows in PRE-L POST-L had lower polymorphonuclear leukocytes percentage at 15 and 28 DIM than cows in PRE-L POST-C, PRE-C POST-L, and PRE-C POST-C. Feeding RPL prepartum downregulates the expression of <i>TLR4</i>, <i>SLC7A6</i>, <i>EHMT2</i>, and tends to downregulate the expression of <i>PTGES3</i> in uterine tissues at 28 DIM. Additionally, it upregulates the expression of <i>APOL3</i> and <i>NFKB1</i>, and tends to upregulate the expression of <i>AHCY</i> and <i>MAT2A</i>. In conclusion, feeding RPL pre- and postpartum improved indicators of uterine immune status, but did not change days to first ovulation postpartum.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Guadagnin","given":"A.R."},{"family":"Fehlberg","given":"L.K."},{"family":"Thomas","given":"B."},{"family":"Sugimoto","given":"Y."},{"family":"Shinzato","given":"I."},{"family":"Cardoso","given":"F.C."}],"citation-key":"guadagninEffectFeedingRumenprotected2022","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/JDS.2022-21934","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8]]},"PMID":"35940923","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of feeding rumen-protected lysine through the transition period on postpartum uterine health of dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030222004453/fulltext","volume":"0"},
  {"id":"Guerra2009","abstract":"The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  {"id":"Hagnestam-Nielsen2009","abstract":"The association between somatic cell count (SCC) and daily milk yield in different stages of lactation was investigated in cows free of clinical mastitis (CM). Data were recorded between 1989 and 2004 in a research herd, and consisted of weekly test-day (TD) records from 1,155 lactations of Swedish Holstein and Swedish Red cows. The main data set (data set A) containing 36,117 records excluded TD affected by CM. In this data set, the geometric mean SCC was 55,000 and 95,000 cells/ mL in primiparous and multiparous cows, respectively. A subset of data set A (data set B), containing 27,753 records excluding all TD sampled in lactations affected by CM, was created to investigate the effect of subclinical mastitis (SCM) in lactations free of CM. Daily milk yields were analyzed using a mixed linear model with lactation stage; linear, quadratic and cubic regressions of log2-transformed and centered SCC nested within lactation stage; weeks in lactation; TD season; parity; breed; pregnancy status; year-season of calving; calving, reproductive, metabolic and claw disorders; and housing system as fixed effects. A random regression was included to further improve the modeling of the lactation curve. Primiparous and multiparous cows were analyzed separately. The magnitude of daily milk loss associated with increased SCC depended on stage of lactation and parity, and was most extensive in late lactation irrespective of parity. In data set A, daily milk loss at an SCC of 500,000 cells/mL ranged from 0.7 to 2.0 kg (3 to 9%) in primiparous cows, depending on stage of lactation. In multiparous cows, corresponding loss was 1.1 to 3.7 kg (4 to 18%). Regression coefficients of primiparous cows estimated from data set B were consistent with those obtained from data set A, whereas data set B generated more negative regression coefficients of multiparous cows suggesting a higher milk loss associated with increased SCC in lactations in which the cow did not develop CM. The 305-d milk loss in the average lactation affected with SCM was 155 kg of milk (2%) in primiparous cows and 445 kg of milk (5%) in multiparous cows. It was concluded that multiparous cows in late lactation can be expected to be responsible for the majority of the herd-level production loss caused by SCM, and that preventive measures need to focus on reducing the incidence of SCM in such cows. © American Dairy Science Association, 2009.","author":[{"family":"Hagnestam-Nielsen","given":"C."},{"family":"Emanuelson","given":"U."},{"family":"Berglund","given":"B."},{"family":"Strandberg","given":"E."}],"citation-key":"Hagnestam-Nielsen2009","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2008-1719","ISSN":"15253198","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"page":"3124-3133","PMID":"19528590","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Relationship between somatic cell count and milk yield in different stages of lactation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2008-1719","volume":"92"},

Significant differences were observed in ruminal volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration. Feeding SRU increased butyrate concentration with no significant effects on concentrations of acetate or propionate. Significant differences were observed in cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations, but glucose, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels were not affected significantly by the treatments.

  {"id":"Halmemies-Beauchet-Filleau2013","abstract":"Diets based on red clover silage (RCS) typically increase the concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in ruminant milk and meat compared with grass silages (GS), an effect that has been attributed to higher activity of polyphenol oxidase in red clover, promoting ruminal escape of dietary lipid. Four multiparous Finnish Ayrshire cows in mid lactation fitted with rumen cannulas were used in a 4×4 Latin Square design with 21-d experimental periods to evaluate the effects of incremental replacement of GS with RCS on ruminal lipid metabolism, using the omasal sampling technique in combination with Cr-EDTA, Yb acetate, and indigestible neutral detergent fiber as markers. Treatments comprised total mixed rations offered ad libitum containing 600 g of forage/kg of diet dry matter, with RCS replacing GS in a ratio of 0:100, 33:67, 67:33, and 100:0 on a dry matter basis. Silages contained a high proportion of lipid as nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), with no difference between forage species (75 and 73% for GS and RCS, respectively). Substitution of GS with RCS had no influence on the intakes of NEFA, polar lipid, triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, monoacylglycerol, or total fatty acids (FA), but altered the ingestion of specific FA. Replacing GS with RCS decreased linearly 18:3n-3 and increased linearly 18:2n-6 intakes. Changes in the proportion of RCS in the diet had no effect on the amounts or on the relative proportions of different lipid fractions at the omasum. On average, NEFA, polar lipid, triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, and monoacylglycerol accounted for 80, 12, 4.4, 2.4, and 0.8% of total FA in omasal digesta, respectively. Replacement of GS with RCS increased linearly the amount of esterified and nonesterified 18:3n-3 at the omasum. Flows of cis-9 18:1 and 18:2n-6 were also increased linearly in response to RCS in the diet, whereas 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-16:0 at the omasum was decreased. Replacing GS with RCS in the diet decreased linearly the lipolysis of dietary esterified lipids in the rumen from 85 to 70%. Effects on lipolysis due to forage species were also associated with linear decreases in apparent ruminal 18:3n-3 biohydrogenation from 93 to 85% and a trend toward lowered biohydrogenation of cis-9 18:1 and 18:2n-6 in the rumen. However, forage species had no effect on the flow of bound phenols formed as a consequence of polyphenol oxidase activity at the omasum. In conclusion, despite minimal differences in the extent of lipolysis in silo, lipid and constituent FA in RCS were less susceptible to ruminal lipolysis and biohydrogenation compared with GS.","author":[{"family":"Halmemies-Beauchet-Filleau","given":"A."},{"family":"Vanhatalo","given":"A."},{"family":"Toivonen","given":"V."},{"family":"Heikkilä","given":"T."},{"family":"Lee","given":"M.R.F."},{"family":"Shingfield","given":"K.J."}],"citation-key":"Halmemies-Beauchet-Filleau2013","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2013-6872","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"5882-5900","PMID":"23849641","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of replacing grass silage with red clover silage on ruminal lipid metabolism in lactating cows fed diets containing a 60:40 forage-to-concentrate ratio","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030213004979","volume":"96"},
  {"id":"Halmemies-Beauchet-Filleau2014","abstract":"Diets based on red clover silage (RCS) typically increase the concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in ruminant meat and milk and lower the efficiency of N utilization compared with grass silages (GS). Four multiparous Finnish Ayrshire cows (108 d postpartum) fitted with rumen cannulas were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design with 21-d periods to evaluate the effect of incremental replacement of GS with RCS on milk production, nutrient digestion, whole-body N metabolism, and milk fatty acid composition. Treatments comprised total mixed rations offered ad libitum, containing 600 g of forage/kg of diet dry matter (DM), with RCS replacing GS in ratios of 0:100, 33:67, 67:33, and 100:0 on a DM basis. Intake of DM and milk yield tended to be higher when RCS and GS were offered as a mixture than when fed alone. Forage species had no influence on the concentration or secretion of total milk fat, whereas replacing GS with RCS tended to decrease milk protein concentration and yield. Substitution of GS with RCS decreased linearly whole-tract apparent organic matter, fiber, and N digestion. Forage species had no effect on total nonammonia N at the omasum, whereas the flow of most AA at the omasum was higher for diets based on a mixture of forages. Replacing GS with RCS progressively lowered protein degradation in the rumen, increased linearly ruminal escape of dietary protein, and decreased linearly microbial protein synthesis. Incremental inclusion of RCS in the diet tended to lower whole-body N balance, increased linearly the proportion of dietary N excreted in feces and urine, and decreased linearly the utilization of dietary N for milk protein synthesis. Furthermore, replacing GS with RCS decreased linearly milk fat 4:0 to 8:0, 14:0, and 16:0 concentrations and increased linearly 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 concentrations, in the absence of changes in cis-9 18:1, cis-9, trans-11 18:2, or total trans fatty acid concentration. Inclusion of RCS in the diet progressively increased the apparent transfer of 18-carbon PUFA from the diet into milk, but had no effect on the amount of 18:2n-6 or 18:3n-3 at the omasum recovered in milk. In conclusion, forage species modified ruminal N metabolism, the flow of AA at the omasum, and whole-body N partitioning. A lower efficiency of N utilization for milk protein synthesis with RCS relative to GS was associated with decreased availability of AA for absorption, with some evidence of an imbalance in the supply of AA relative to requirements. Higher enrichment of PUFA in milk for diets based on RCS was related to an increased supply for absorption, with no indication that forage species substantially altered PUFA bioavailability.","author":[{"family":"Halmemies-Beauchet-Filleau","given":"A."},{"family":"Vanhatalo","given":"A."},{"family":"Toivonen","given":"V."},{"family":"Heikkilä","given":"T."},{"family":"Lee","given":"M.R.F."},{"family":"Shingfield","given":"K.J."}],"citation-key":"Halmemies-Beauchet-Filleau2014","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2013-7358","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"3761-3776","PMID":"24679932","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of replacing grass silage with red clover silage on nutrient digestion, nitrogen metabolism, and milk fat composition in lactating cows fed diets containing a 60:40 forage-to-concentrate ratio","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030214002173","volume":"97"},

  {"id":"Hammon2006","abstract":"The objectives of this study were to investigate the associations between peripheral blood neutrophil (PMN) function, energy status, and uterine health in periparturient dairy cows. Data were collected from 83 multiparous Holstein cows. Blood samples for PMN function determination were collected weekly from 1 week prior to calving (week -1) through 4 weeks after calving and again at 8 weeks after calving. Energy metabolites were measured and dry matter intake (DMI) was determined from weeks -2 to 5 to evaluate energy status of cows during the periparturient period. All cows were examined for uterine health disorders. Blood PMN killing ability was evaluated by determining myeloperoxidase activity and cytochrome c reduction activity in isolated blood PMN's. For cows that were diagnosed with puerperal metritis and subclinical (SC) endometritis and puerperal metritis, blood PMN functions were significantly (P < 0.05) impaired during the periparturient period, compared to cows with normal uterine health. Cows with subclinical endometritis and puerperal metritis or SC endometritis also had significantly (P < 0.01) higher NEFA and significantly (P < 0.001) lower DMI during the periparturient period, and significantly (P < 0.05) higher BHBA during early lactation, compared to cows with normal uterine health. Neutrophil function was also significantly (P < 0.01) impaired in cows with peripartum negative energy balance, which was characterized by elevated blood levels of NEFA and decreased DMI. Decreased PMN function and energy balance were associated with uterine health disorders and the decreases in PMN function and energy balance occurred prior to parturition and prior to the detection of these uterine disorders. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  {"id":"hanigan2010","abstract":"The lactating dairy cow is fairly inefficient at converting dietary nitrogen to milk protein. When cows are fed to National Research Council (NRC, 2001) requirements, they convert approximately 25 percent of dietary nitrogen to milk protein. There may be some inherent limitations to the efficiency that can be achieved by a ruminant; however, examination of the NRC model with respect to available data suggests several areas where requirement or supply predictions could be improved. Ruminally degradable protein requirements appear to be too high. Reducing these requirements would allow reductions in dietary protein and improved animal efficiency. Amino acid (AA) flow to the small intestine appears to be predicted with good accuracy, provided diets are within current NRC requirements for ruminally degradable protein. Absorption of AA from the gut lumen is not constant across AA within an ingredient or across ingredients as assumed by NRC. Thus, absorbed AA may be predicted with bias. The gut tissues as represented in the portal-drained viscera and the liver remove approximately two-thirds of the available AA on a daily basis, and this removal is dependent on supply. Variable use by these maintenance tissues violates the NRC assumption of fixed maintenance use and introduces a significant bias in our current predictions. Mammary AA removal is highly regulated and counters supply (i.e., as supply declines transport activity increases and vice versa). Variable transport activity with respect to AA supply violates the NRC assumption of fixed conversion efficiencies for absorbed AA and introduces bias into predictions. Thus, our ability to successfully balance diets for adequate AA while minimizing dietary nitrogen inputs is currently hampered by a lack of data with respect to AA digestibility in the small intestine and poor representations of postabsorptive use of AA. Amino acid digestibility coefficients for individual ingredients are needed to address the first challenge, and an alternate representation of postabsorptive use and recycling of AA is required to address the second challenge.","author":[{"family":"Hanigan","given":"M D"},{"family":"Cyriac","given":"J."}],"citation-key":"hanigan2010","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"publisher":"eXtension","title":"Current Status of Amino Acid Requirement Models for Lactating Dairy Cows","type":"report","URL":"http://www.extension.org/pages/11231/current-status-of-amino-acid-requirement-models-for-lactating-dairy-cows"},

  {"id":"Harada2008","abstract":"β-Glucans are major cell wall structural components in fungi. As they are not found in animals, these carbohydrates are considered to be classic pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and are recognized by the innate immune system. Although their immunomodulating activities have been shown to be associated with the recognition of some fungi, and with their medicinal properties in the field of cancer immunotherapy, it is still unclear how β-glucans mediate their effects. Recent studies have started to shed some light on their cellular receptors, such as dectin-1, and their molecular mechanisms of action. We have extensively investigated the response of leukocytes to β-glucan, focusing on cytokine induction by SCG, which is a major 6-branched 1,3-β-d-glucan in Sparassis crispa Fr. There is a strain difference in the reactivity of mice to SCG, and DBA/1 and DBA/2 mice are highly sensitive strains. In the process of research on cytokine induction by SCG in DBA/2 mice, we found that GM-CSF plays a key biological role in this activity. Cytokine induction by SCG was completely abolished in dendritic cells from dectin-1 knockout mice. On the other hand, controlling the level of endogenous GM-CSF production and/or dectin-1 expression could regulate the reactivity to β-glucan. These results indicate that the key factors in the responsiveness to β-glucan are GM-CSF production and dectin-1 expression. In this review, we describe how the key molecules related to the expression of the immunomodulating activities of β-glucan were identified, and how the response to β-glucan is controlled. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Rumen-protected choline (RPC) was fed with two levels of RUP to 48 multiparous Holstein cows in a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Beginning 28 d before expected calving, cows were fed 10% rumen degradable protein, either 0, 6, or 12 g/d of RPC as CapShure (Balchem Corp., Slate Hill, NY) and either 4.0 or 6.2% RUP. After calving and through 120 d of lactation, cows received a common diet and continued RPC as per their prepartum assignment. Prepartum dry matter intake (kg/d) was not affected by RPC or RUP. Postpartum intake decreased when 6.2% RUP was fed prepartum. Milk production to 56 d in milk was decreased when cows were fed 6.2% RUP prepartum. Milk protein (kg/d) decreased when additional RUP was fed prepartum. Cows fed RPC lost more weight during the study period and tended to lose more body condition. Plasma urea nitrogen levels in the prepartum period were reduced for cows fed 4.0% RUP prepartum. Mean liver triacylglyceride determined from samples obtained at -28, -14, +1, +28, and +56 d in milk was not affected by RPC, prepartum RUP, or their combinations. Feeding 12 g of RPC/d in conjunction with 4.0% RUP increased milk production, but feeding RPC with 6.2% RUP prepartum and through 56 d in milk decreased production.

Dietary supplementation with yeast derivatives (YD) contributes to the health and physiology of sows and piglets, but few studies have focused on how it influences gut health and performance of sows and piglets. The goal was therefore to examine whether YD, based on brewer’s yeast hydrolysate added to pregnancy diet, would affect colostrum composition, yield (CY) and gut microbiota of sows and piglets. Sows were allocated to either a control diet (n = 19) or a control diet supplemented with 2g YD/kg (n = 18) during the pregnancy. Piglets suckling belonging to the control sows (n = 114) and supplemented sows (n = 108) were also included in the study. Gut microbiota populations of sows at farrowing and piglets at one and four weeks of age were assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Colostrum samples were examined for nutritional composition and immunoglobulin (Ig) content. All piglets were individually weighed at birth and 24 hours later in order to calculate CY, and later at four weeks to calculate average daily gain (ADG). Protein, lactose and dry matter content of colostrum did not significantly differ between the two groups, while sows fed YD had higher levels of fat in their colostrum (P < 0.05). Immunoglobulin A, IgM and IgG levels in colostrum did not differ between the two groups (P > 0.05). Colostrum yield was lower in the control than that in YD group (3701g vs. 4581 g; P < 0.05). Although the YD supplementation did not change fecal bacteria diversity in sow, more beneficial and fermentative bacteria (Roseburia, Paraprevotella, Eubacterium) were found in the YD fed group (P < 0.01) while, some opportunistic pathogens, including Proteobacteria, especially the genera Desulfovibrio, Escherichia/Shigella and Helicobacter, were suppressed. Piglets at one week of age from sows fed YD had more beneficial microbial populations with significant diversity and fewer opportunistic pathogens. Additionally, we established a Pearson’s correlations between CY, colostrum components, piglet birth weight and fecal microbiota. Therefore, YD added to the sow diet during pregnancy increases colostrum availability and its energy content for neonate piglets, also promoting beneficial maternal microbial sources for neonate.","author":[{"family":"Hasan","given":"Shah"},{"family":"Junnikkala","given":"Sami"},{"family":"Peltoniemi","given":"Olli"},{"family":"Paulin","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Lyyski","given":"Annina"},{"family":"Vuorenmaa","given":"Juhani"},{"family":"Oliviero","given":"Claudio"}],"citation-key":"Hasan2018","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0197586","ISBN":"1111111111","ISSN":"19326203","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"1-17","PMID":"29795617","title":"Dietary supplementation with yeast hydrolysate in pregnancy influences colostrum yield and gut microbiota of sows and piglets after birth","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

At calving all cows were fed the same lactating TMR (14.9% CP, 1.68 Mcal/kg of NEL) and followed for 28 d. During the dry period, cows fed the LF diet had greater DM intake (15.3 ± 0.24 vs. 13.4 ± 0.24 kg/d) and tended to have a shorter interval between meals (192.8 ± 8.38 vs. 216.5 ± 7.97 min) and more frequent meals (6.3 ± 0.27 vs. 5.6 ± 0.27 meals/d), while consuming their feed faster (0.09 ± 0.001 vs. 0.08 ± 0.001 kg of DM/min) compared with cows fed the CON diet. Regardless of treatment, cows sorted [100% × (actual intake/predicted intake)] against the longest ration particles (>19 mm), with cows fed the CON diet sorting more against these (81.1 ± 2.6 vs. 93.9 ± 2.6%). Cows fed the CON diet did not sort for or against short particles (<8, >4 mm; 100.2 ± 0.31%), but cows fed the LF diet tended to sort against these (99.2 ± 0.31%). Post-calving, cows fed the LF diet did not sort for long particles (98.5 ± 1.1%), but cows fed the CON diet continued to sort against these (96.3 ± 1.1%).

A multi-breed reference population is a potential solution, and here we investigate the accuracies of GEBV in Holstein dairy cattle and Jersey dairy cattle when the reference population is single breed or multi-breed. The accuracies were obtained both as a function of elements of the inverse coefficient matrix and from the realised accuracies of GEBV.\n\nMETHODS: Best linear unbiased prediction with a multi-breed genomic relationship matrix (GBLUP) and two Bayesian methods (BAYESA and BAYES_SSVS) which estimate individual SNP effects were used to predict GEBV for 400 and 77 young Holstein and Jersey bulls respectively, from a reference population of 781 and 287 Holstein and Jersey bulls, respectively. Genotypes of 39,048 SNP markers were used. Phenotypes in the reference population were de-regressed breeding values for production traits. For the GBLUP method, expected accuracies calculated from the diagonal of the inverse of coefficient matrix were compared to realised accuracies.\n\nRESULTS: When GBLUP was used, expected accuracies from a function of elements of the inverse coefficient matrix agreed reasonably well with realised accuracies calculated from the correlation between GEBV and EBV in single breed populations, but not in multi-breed populations. When the Bayesian methods were used, realised accuracies of GEBV were up to 13% higher when the multi-breed reference population was used than when a pure breed reference was used. However no consistent increase in accuracy across traits was obtained.\n\nCONCLUSION: Predicting genomic breeding values using a genomic relationship matrix is an attractive approach to implement genomic selection as expected accuracies of GEBV can be readily derived. However in multi-breed populations, Bayesian approaches give higher accuracies for some traits. Finally, multi-breed reference populations will be a valuable resource to fine map QTL.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Hayes","given":"Ben J"},{"family":"Bowman","given":"Phillip J"},{"family":"Chamberlain","given":"Amanda C"},{"family":"Verbyla","given":"Klara"},{"family":"Goddard","given":"Mike E"}],"citation-key":"Hayes2009","container-title":"Genetics, selection, evolution : GSE","DOI":"10.1186/1297-9686-41-51","ISSN":"1297-9686","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",1]]},"page":"51","PMID":"19930712","title":"Accuracy of genomic breeding values in multi-breed dairy cattle populations.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2791750&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"Hedges2001a","abstract":"A longitudinal prospective intervention study investigated the effect of biotin supplementation on the incidence (new cases per day) of visible lameness in milking cows and heifers on five commercial farms in Gloucestershire, United Kingdom. The trial lasted from June 1997 to April 1999. Each farm participated in the trial for 18 mo. Within each herd the cows were randomly allocated to either receive a supplement of 20 mg of biotin per day or not. All cows were run as one herd on each farm. When a lame cow was identified, the farmer called one of six veterinarians to examine and treat the affected animal; findings were recorded on a standard form. A veterinarian also carried out a bimonthly locomotion assessment to ensure that all lame cows were diagnosed. There were a total of 900 cows, 1120 cow years, in the trial. The overall incidence rate of lameness (per 100 cows per year) was 68.9, with a range of 31.6 to 111.5 per farm. The incidence rates of the four most frequently reported causes of lameness were sole ulcer, 13.8; white line separation, 12.7; digital dermatitis, 12.0; and interdigital necrobacillosis, 7.1 per 100 cows per year. There was a significant difference in the incidence rate of these four lesions between supplemented and unsupplemented cows on two of the five farms, with a significant decrease in lameness in the cows supplemented with biotin. When all the farms were pooled, the risk of lameness caused by white line separation in cattle supplemented with biotin was approximately halved (Cox proportional hazard survival analysis hazard ratio = 0.57).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hedges","given":"J"},{"family":"Blowey","given":"R W"},{"family":"Packington","given":"a J"},{"family":"O'Callaghan","given":"C J"},{"family":"Green","given":"L E"}],"citation-key":"Hedges2001a","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(01)74639-5","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",9]]},"page":"1969-75","PMID":"11573775","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"A longitudinal field trial of the effect of biotin on lameness in dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11573775","volume":"84"},

  {"id":"Heikkila2012","abstract":"Bovine mastitis is an economic and a welfare problem on dairy farms. The objective of this study was to estimate the costs of clinical mastitis (CM), having a special focus on the cost variation related to culling decisions. A dynamic optimization model was developed to determine an optimal replacement time of a mastitic cow and to estimate the costs of CM, taking into account the risk of premature culling and the uncertainty in CM prevalence. Six lactations were analyzed at monthly periods for Ayrshire and Holstein-Friesian breeds. The estimates reflect Finnish production conditions where mastitis is treated only by veterinarians. Biological parameters of the model were adapted from the literature and the Finnish dairy herd health recording system. Field data were used to produce the risk parameters of culling due to mastitis on commercial dairy farms. The model recommended treating the cows with CM and keeping them in most cases until their fifth lactation. A cheaper (-20%) heifer transferred the optimum to the previous lactation and a more expensive (+20%) heifer to the following lactation. Conditional on optimal replacements, the average cost of CM of an Ayrshire (Holstein-Friesian costs in parentheses) cow was €485 (€458), varying from €209 (€112) to €1,006 (€946). The costs were at the highest when the occurrence of CM was at a top yield phase. In the scenario where the risk of culling due to mastitis was included in the model, the average cost of CM was €596 (€623). Disposing of a young cow at the end of her first lactation month caused the highest costs. The costs converted to figures per cow-year were €121 (€147) with optimal cullings and €155 (€191) in the current Finnish conditions. Thus, the increase in the costs of CM due to premature cullings was 28% (30%.) The main cost sources were long-term production losses regardless of the culling decisions. Premature culling formed 20% (23%) of the total costs. To decrease the costs of CM, more emphasis should be given to hidden costs, especially the high cost of premature culling should be underlined. © 2012 American Dairy Science Association.","author":[{"family":"Heikkilä","given":"A.

  {"id":"Heinrichs2007","abstract":"Measurement of heart-girth (chest circumference) is commonly used to estimate dairy heifer body weight from previously derived equations or tables. In this experiment, variability of heart-girth measurements as they are taken in the field was analyzed to determine the standard deviation within a group of 26 Holstein heifers of various ages weighing 42-590 kg. Standard deviations were 2.19 cm among 26 observers and 2.74 cm within any one observer. Repeatability between two heart-girth measurements by an individual observer on the same animal using a blind heart-girth tape was >0.99. Correlation coefficients between two measurements by different observers using blind measuring tapes on the same animal also were >0.99, with 99% of total differences due to observer and heifer, indicating very little random variation. A second part of this study was the validation of the most recently derived equation to calculate body weight from heart-girth. The equation was validated with data sets from universities across the United States and field data collected specifically for this study. Experimental and field data comprised of heart-girth and body weight measurements upheld the previously derived equation and support its continued use. These results allow more precise interpretation of heart-girth data collected from field studies with Holstein dairy heifers and provide more complete validation of existing body weight-prediction equations. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  {"id":"Herlihy2012","abstract":"The objective of this study was to compare circulating progesterone (P4) profiles and pregnancies per AI (P/AI) in lactating dairy cows bred by timed artificial insemination (TAI) following Ovsynch-56 after 2 different presynchronization protocols: Double-Ovsynch (DO) or Presynch-Ovsynch (PS). Our main hypothesis was that DO would increase fertility in primiparous cows, but not in multiparous cows. Within each herd (n = 3), lactating dairy cows (n = 1,687; 778 primiparous, 909 multiparous) were randomly assigned to DO [n = 837; GnRH-7d-PGF(2α)-3d-GnRH-7d-Ovsynch-56 (GnRH-7d-PGF(2α)-56h-GnRH-16hTAI)] or PS (n = 850; PGF(2α)-14d-PGF(2α)-12d-Ovsynch-56). In 1 herd, concentrations of P4 were determined at the first GnRH (GnRH1) of Ovsynch-56 and at d 11 after TAI (n = 739). In all herds, pregnancy was diagnosed by palpation per rectum at 39 d. In 1 herd, the incidence of late embryo loss was determined at 74 d, and data were available on P/AI at the subsequent second service. Presynchronization with DO reduced the percentage of animals with low P4 concentrations (<0.50 ng/mL) at GnRH1 of Ovsynch-56 (5.4 vs. 25.3%, DO vs. PS). A lesser percentage of both primiparous and multiparous cows treated with DO had low P4 concentrations at GnRH1 of Ovsynch-56 (3.3 vs. 19.7%, DO vs. PS primiparous; and 8.8 vs. 31.9%, DO vs. PS multiparous). Presynchronization with DO improved P/AI at the first postpartum service (46.3 vs. 38.2%, DO vs. PS). Statistically, a fertility improvement could be detected for primiparous cows treated with DO (52.5 vs. 42.3%, DO vs. PS, primiparous), but only a tendency could be detected in multiparous cows (40.3 vs. 34.3%, DO vs. PS, multiparous), consistent with our original hypothesis. Presynchronization treatment had no effect on the incidence of late embryo loss after first service (8.5 vs. 5.5%, DO vs. PS). A lower body condition score increased the percentage of cows with low P4 at GnRH1 of Ovsynch-56 and reduced fertility to the TAI. In addition, P4 concentration at d 11 after TAI was reduced by DO. The method of presynchronization at first service had no effect on P/AI at the subsequent second service (34.7 vs. 36.5%, DO vs. PS). Thus, presynchronization with DO induced cyclicity in most anovular cows and improved fertility compared with PS, suggesting that DO could be a useful reproductive management protocol for synchronizing first service in commercial dairy herds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Herlihy","given":"M M"},{"family":"Giordano","given":"J O"},{"family":"Souza","given":"a H"},{"family":"Ayres","given":"H"},{"family":"Ferreira","given":"R M"},{"family":"Keskin","given":"a"},{"family":"Nascimento","given":"a B"},{"family":"Guenther","given":"J N"},{"family":"Gaska","given":"J M"},{"family":"Kacuba","given":"S J"},{"family":"Crowe","given":"M","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Butler","given":"S T"},{"family":"Wiltbank","given":"M C"}],"citation-key":"Herlihy2012","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2011-5260","ISSN":"1525-3198","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",9,26]]},"page":"7003-7014","PMID":"23021750","title":"Presynchronization with Double-Ovsynch improves fertility at first postpartum artificial insemination in lactating dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23021750"},

  {"id":"hill2008","abstract":"The relative proportion of additive and non-additive variation for complex traits is important in evolutionary biology, medicine, and agriculture. We address a long-standing controversy and paradox about the contribution of non-additive genetic variation, namely that knowledge about biological pathways and gene networks imply that epistasis is important. Yet empirical data across a range of traits and species imply that most genetic variance is additive. We evaluate the evidence from empirical studies of genetic variance components and find that additive variance typically accounts for over half, and often close to 100%, of the total genetic variance. We present new theoretical results, based upon the distribution of allele frequencies under neutral and other population genetic models, that show why this is the case even if there are non-additive effects at the level of gene action. We conclude that interactions at the level of genes are not likely to generate much interaction at the level of variance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Hill","given":"William G"},{"family":"Goddard","given":"Michael E"},{"family":"Visscher","given":"Peter M"}],"citation-key":"hill2008","container-title":"PLoS genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1000008","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",2]]},"page":"e1000008","PMID":"18454194","title":"Data and theory point to mainly additive genetic variance for complex traits","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2265475&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"Hill2008a","abstract":"A dynamic, mechanistic, compartmental model of phosphorus (P) digestion and metabolism was constructed in the Advanced Continuous Simulation Language using conservation of mass principles and mass action kinetics. Phosphorus was assumed to exist in 3 forms: inorganic (Pi), phytic acid (Pp), and organic (excluding phytic acid; Po). All 3 forms were assumed to be present in the digestive tract with absorption of Pi into blood. Inputs to the model were total P intake; Pp, Po, and Pi as proportions of total P; milk yield; rate of salivation (fixed at 239 L/d); and rate of liquid passage from the rumen (fixed at 198 L/d). The model was fitted to 2 experiments from the literature. Derived parameters were well defined by the data. With a mean observed P intake of 75 g/d, total tract P digestibility was 38%. Phytic acid P digestibility in the rumen was 74%, with no additional Pp digestion in the lower tract. Inorganic P and Po digestibility in the lower tract were 48 and 89%, respectively. Flows of Po and Pi from the rumen were 2.4 and 3.0 times greater than intake, respectively. The increase in Po was apparently due to microbial growth. The increase in Pi arose primarily from secretion of Pi into the rumen via salivation where 65% of absorbed P was recycled to the rumen. Milk synthesis used 30% of absorbed Pi, and 1% was excreted in urine. This research suggested that the primary regulation points for maintaining blood P were bone deposition and resorption and absorption from the intestine. However, because bone P balance was related to both dietary P intake and ruminal phytase activity, it is critical to achieve a better understanding of phytate digestibility across several feeds if dietary P is to be reduced below current requirements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Hill","given":"S R"},{"family":"Knowlton","given":"K F"},{"family":"Kebreab","given":"E"},{"family":"France","given":"J"},{"family":"Hanigan","given":"M D"}],"citation-key":"Hill2008a","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2007-0668","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",5]]},"page":"2021-32","PMID":"18420632","title":"A model of phosphorus digestion and metabolism in the lactating dairy cow.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18420632","volume":"91"},
  {"id":"Hill2009","abstract":"The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of the addition of cottonseed hulls (CSH) to the starter and the supplementation of live yeast product (YST) or mannanoligosaccharide product (MOS) to milk, on growth, intake, rumen development, and health parameters in young calves. Holstein (n = 116) and Jersey (n = 46) bull (n = 74) and heifer (n = 88) calves were assigned randomly within sex at birth to treatments. All calves were fed 3.8 L of colostrum daily for the first 2 d. Holstein calves were fed 3.8 L of whole milk, and Jersey calves were fed 2.8 L of whole milk through weaning at 42 d. Calves continued on trial through 63 d. Six treatments were arranged as a 2 x 3 factorial. Calves received either a corn-soybean meal-based starter (21% crude protein and 6% acid detergent fiber; -CSH) or a blend of 85% corn-soybean meal-based starter and 15% CSH (18% crude protein and 14% acid detergent fiber; +CSH) ad libitum. In addition, calves received whole milk with either no supplement (NONE) or supplemented with 3 g/d of mannanoligosaccharide product (MOS) or 4 g/d of live yeast product (YST) through weaning at 42 d. Twelve Holstein steers [n = 6 (per starter type); n = 4 (per supplement type)] were euthanized for collection and examination of rumen tissue samples. Dry matter intake (DMI) was greater for Holstein calves fed +CSH (0.90 kg/d) than -CSH (0.76 kg/d). Final body weight at 63 d of Holstein calves fed +CSH (75.8 kg) was greater than that of those fed -CSH (71.0 kg). Average daily gain (ADG) was greater for Holstein calves fed +CSH (0.58 kg/d) than -CSH (0.52 kg/d). However, Holstein calves fed -CSH had a greater feed efficiency (FE; 0.71 kg of ADG/kg of DMI) than those fed +CSH (0.65 kg of ADG/kg of DMI). Also, Holstein calves fed +CSH had narrower rumen papillae (0.32 mm) compared with those fed -CSH (0.41 mm). There were no significant effects of CSH on DMI, ADG, or FE in Jersey calves. There were no significant effects of YST or MOS on DMI, ADG, FE, or rumen papillae measures in Holstein calves. Jersey calves fed YST or MOS had greater final body weight at 63 d (51.2 kg and 51.0 kg, respectively) than calves fed NONE (47.5 kg). However, there were no significant effects of YST or MOS on DMI, ADG, or FE in Jersey calves.","author":[{"family":"Hill","given":"S R"},{"family":"Hopkins","given":"B","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Davidson","given":"S"},{"family":"Bolt","given":"S M"},{"family":"Diaz","given":"D E"},{"family":"Brownie","given":"C"},{"family":"Brown","given":"T"},{"family":"Huntington","given":"G B"},{"family":"Whitlow","given":"L W"}],"citation-key":"Hill2009","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2008-1320","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"page":"790-8","PMID":"19164693","title":"The addition of cottonseed hulls to the starter and supplementation of live yeast or mannanoligosaccharide in the milk for young calves.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19164693","volume":"92"},

  {"id":"Hill2013","abstract":"Due to renewed interest in feeding acidified milk replacer (MR) for ad libitum consumption within North America, two 112-d trials were conducted using Holstein calves obtained from one dairy farm at 2 to 3 d of age. In trial 1, a 27% crude protein (whey protein), 17% fat MR powder was reconstituted with water to 14% solids and fed at 0.66 kg of dry matter (DM) per day for 42 d (CON) or acidified to pH 4.2 using citric acid and offered 24 h/d for d 0 to 35, then switched to 0.66 kg of DM without acid per d for 7 d (A4). In trial 2, the same MR was fed as CON, ad libitum pH 5.2 MR offered from 0600 to 0800 h and 1600 to 1800 h for d 0 to 21 (R5), ad libitum pH 5.2 MR offered 24 h/d for d 0 to 35 (A5), and ad libitum pH 4.2 MR offered 24 h/d for d 0 to 35 (A4). After the ad libitum period, calves on R5, A5, and A4 were switched to CON until d 42. Growth measures were made until d 112 in each trial. Data from each trial were analyzed as a completely randomized design with repeated measurements over time using an autoregressive type 1 covariance structure when appropriate. In each trial, calves fed CON had lower average daily gain (ADG) from 0 to 42 d and greater ADG from 42 to 56 d than calves fed the other treatments. In both trials, ADG from 0 to 56 d and 56 to 112 d were not greater for A4 or A5 versus CON. From 56 to 112 d in trial 2, ADG was greater for R5 versus A5. Some calves completely rejected the MR at pH 4.2. Calves consumed more of the MR at pH 5.2 than 4.2. Calves fed A4 in trial 1 and treatments A5 and A4 in trial 2 consumed >95% of their MR between 0600 to 0800 h and 1600 to 1800 h. Time spent standing did not differ by treatment in trial 1 and increased from 312 to 332 min/d from d 6 to 56. Under the conditions of these trials, results to 112 d showed no advantage to feeding calves MR acidified to pH 4.2 or 5.2 ad libitum from 0 to 35 d with gradually weaning by 42 d compared with calves fed the control MR fed at 0.66 kg of DM/d. Additionally, when calves were fed MR ad libitum, they consumed >95% of the MR between 0600 to 0800 h and 1600 to 1800 h and standing behavior was not greatly affected.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Hill","given":"T M"},{"family":"Bateman","given":"H G"},{"family":"Aldrich","given":"J M"},{"family":"Quigley","given":"J D"},{"family":"Schlotterbeck","given":"R L"}],"citation-key":"Hill2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-6132","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,1]]},"page":"3153-3162","PMID":"23466327","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Evaluation of ad libitum acidified milk replacer programs for dairy calves.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23466327","volume":"96"},

  {"id":"holtshausen2011","abstract":"A 3-part study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a developmental fibrolytic enzyme additive on the digestibility of selected forages and the production performance of early-lactation dairy cows. In part 1, 4 replicate 24-h batch culture in vitro incubations were conducted with alfalfa hay, alfalfa silage, and barley silage as substrates and ruminal fluid as the inoculum. A developmental fibrolytic enzyme additive (AB Vista, Marlborough, UK) was added at 5 doses: 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 [mu]L/g of forage dry matter (DM). After the 24-h incubation, DM, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) disappearance were determined. For alfalfa hay, DM, NDF, and ADF disappearance was greater at the highest dosage compared with no enzyme addition. Barley silage NDF and ADF and alfalfa silage NDF disappearance tended to be greater for the highest enzyme dosage compared with no enzyme addition. In part 2, 6 ruminally cannulated, lactating Holstein dairy cows were used to determine in situ degradation of alfalfa and barley silage, with (1.0 mL/kg of silage DM) and without added enzyme. Three cows received a control diet (no enzyme added) and the other 3 received an enzyme-supplemented (1.0 mL/kg of diet DM) diet. Enzyme addition after the 24 h in situ incubation did not affect the disappearance of barley silage or alfalfa silage. In part 3, 60 early-lactation Holstein dairy cows were fed 1 of 3 diets for a 10-wk period: (1) control (CTL; no enzyme), (2) low enzyme (CTL treated with 0.5 mL of enzyme/kg of diet DM), and (3) high enzyme (CTL treated with 1.0 mL of enzyme/kg of diet DM). Adding enzyme to the diet had no effect on milk yield, but dry matter intake was lower for the high enzyme treatment and tended to be lower for the low enzyme treatment compared with CTL. Consequently, milk production efficiency (kg of 3.5% fat-corrected milk/kg of DM intake) linearly increased with increasing enzyme addition. Cows fed the low and high enzyme diets were 5.3 (not statistically significant) and 11.3% more efficient, respectively, compared with CTL cows. This developmental fibrolytic enzyme additive has the potential to increase fiber digestibility of forages, which could lead to greater milk production efficiency for dairy cows in early lactation.","author":[{"family":"Holtshausen","given":"L"},{"family":"Chung","given":"Y.-H."},{"family":"Gerardo-Cuervo","given":"H"},{"family":"Oba","given":"M"},{"family":"Beauchemin","given":"K A"}],"citation-key":"holtshausen2011","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"DOI: 10.3168/jds.2010-3573","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"page":"899-907","title":"Improved milk production efficiency in early lactation dairy cattle with dietary addition of a developmental fibrolytic enzyme additive","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B9887-520NK8X-19/2/123a9e6afa49af38d0f2d284859e5193","volume":"94"},

  {"id":"horstauerbachEffectsVariousAdditives2020","abstract":"Whole-crop cereal silage represents an important component of ruminant diets and is used as a substrate for biogas production. Due to the scarcity of data on whole-crop rye (Secale cereale L., WCR), our study aimed to evaluate the eﬀects of a range of biological and chemical additives of diﬀerent compositions on the fermentation and aerobic stability of silage made from this species. In addition, the production of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which potentially contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, was monitored. Regardless of additive treatment, all WCR silages were well fermented as reﬂected by the complete absence of butyric acid. Inoculants containing Lactobacillus buchneri and chemical additives reduced dry matter (DM) losses during fermentation for 53 days (p < 0.001), which were closely related with the concentration of ethanol upon silo opening (R2 = 0.88, p < 0.001). Silage treated with Lactobacillus buchneri, alone or in combination with a homofermentative strain, had the lowest yeast count (p < 0.001) and, simultaneously, the highest aerobic stability (p < 0.001). Chemical additives outperformed all other additives by largely restricting the formation of ethyl esters of lactic and acetic acids (p < 0.001). The concentration of ethanol strongly correlated with those of ethyl lactate (R2 = 0.94, p < 0.001), ethyl acetate (R2 = 0.85, p < 0.001), and total ethyl esters (R2 = 0.94, p < 0.001). The use of a simple linear regression model exclusively based on the ethanol content proved useful to predict the concentration of total ethyl esters in WCR silage (R2 = 0.93, p < 0.001).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,18]]},"author":[{"literal":"Horst Auerbach"},{"family":"Theobald","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Kroschewski","given":"Bärbel"},{"family":"Weiss","given":"Kirsten"}],"citation-key":"horstauerbachEffectsVariousAdditives2020","container-title":"Agronomy","container-title-short":"Agronomy","DOI":"10.3390/agronomy10121873","ISSN":"2073-4395","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,27]]},"language":"en","page":"1873","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effects of Various Additives on Fermentation, Aerobic Stability and Volatile Organic Compounds in Whole-Crop Rye Silage","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/10/12/1873","volume":"10"},

Eight ruminally cannulated Holstein cows were allocated to 2 dietary treatments in a crossover design. Treat-ments were control (no yeast culture) and XP (yeast culture, fed at 56 g/head per day; XP, Diamond V Mills Inc., Cedar Rapids, IA). Dry matter intake, milk yield, milk composition, and body weight were similar between treatments. Milk urea nitrogen concentration was also not affected by treatment. Rumen pH was similar between the control and XP treatments, but rumen ammonia concentration tended to be lower with XP than with the control. Treatment had no effect on concentrations of total or individual volatile fatty acids, protozoal counts, polysaccharide-degrading activities (except amylase activity that tended to be increased by XP), or methane production in the rumen. Urinary N losses did not differ significantly between treatments, but allantoin and total purine derivative excretions and the estimated microbial N outflow from the ru-men tended to be increased by XP compared with the control treatment. Total-tract apparent digestibility of dietary nutrients was not affected by XP. Milk fatty acid composition was also not altered by XP supple-mentation. Cumulative (253 h) ammonia and methane emissions from manure, measured in a steady-state gas emission system, were slightly decreased by XP. Over-all, the yeast culture tested had little effect on ruminal fermentation, digestibility, or N losses, but tended to reduce rumen ammonia concentration and increase mi-crobial protein synthesis in the rumen, and decreased ammonia and methane emissions from manure.","author":[{"family":"Hristov","given":"A.N."},{"family":"Varga","given":"G."},{"family":"Cassidy","given":"T."},{"family":"Long","given":"M."},{"family":"Heyler","given":"K."},{"family":"Karnati","given":"S.K.R."},{"family":"Corl","given":"B."},{"family":"Hovde","given":"C.J."},{"family":"Yoon","given":"I."}],"citation-key":"Hristov2010","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2009-2379","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"page":"682-692","PMID":"20105539","title":"Effect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product on ruminal fermentation and nutrient utilization in dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030210715101","volume":"93"},

  {"id":"Huijps2008","abstract":"A model to calculate the economic losses of mastitis on an average Dutch dairy farm was developed and used as base for a tool for farmers and advisors to calculate farm-specific economic losses of mastitis. The economic losses of a clinical case in a default situation were calculated as €210, varying from €164 to €235 depending on the month of lactation. The total economic losses of mastitis (subclinical and clinical) per cow present in a default situation varied between €65 and €182/cow per year depending on the bulk tank somatic cell count. The tool was used to measure perception of the total economic losses of mastitis on the farm and the farmers' assessment of the cost factors of mastitis on 78 dairy farms, of which 64 were used for further analyses. Most farmers (72%) expected their economic losses to be lower than those revealed by our calculation made with their farm information. Underestimating the economic losses of mastitis can be regarded as a general problem in the dairy sector. The average economic losses assessed by the farmers were €78/cow per year, but a large variation was given, €17-198/cow per year. Although the average assessment of the farmers of the different cost factors is close to the default value, there is much variation. To improve the adoption rate of advice and lower the incidence of mastitis, it is important to show the farmers the economic losses of mastitis on their farm.

  {"id":"hulshof2012","abstract":"The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dietary nitrate on methane emission and rumen fermentation parameters in Nellore × Guzera (Bos indicus) beef cattle fed a sugarcane based diet. The experiment was conducted with 16 steers weighing 283 ± 49 kg (mean ± SD), 6 rumen cannulated and 10 intact steers, in a cross-over design. The animals were blocked according to BW and presence or absence of rumen cannula and randomly allocated to either the nitrate diet (22 g nitrate/kg DM) or the control diet made isonitrogenous by the addition of urea. The diets consisted of freshly chopped sugarcane and concentrate (60:40 on DM basis), fed as a mixed ration. A 16-d adaptation period was used to allow the rumen microbes to adapt to dietary nitrate. Methane emission was measured using the sulfur hexafluoride tracer technique. Dry matter intake (P = 0.09) tended to be less when nitrate was present in the diet compared with the control, 6.60 and 7.05 kg/d DMI, respectively. The daily methane production was reduced (P &lt; 0.01) by 32% when steers were fed the nitrate diet (85 g/d) compared with the urea diet (125 g/d). Methane emission per kilogram DMI was 27% less (P &lt; 0.01) on the nitrate diet (13.3 g methane/kg DMI) than on the control diet (18.2 g methane/kg DMI). Methane losses as a fraction of gross energy intake (GEI) were less (P &lt; 0.01) on the nitrate diet (4.2% of GEI) than on the control diet (5.9% of GEI). Nitrate mitigated enteric methane production by 87% of the theoretical potential. The rumen fluid ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) concentration was significantly greater (P &lt; 0.05) for the nitrate diet.

We recently showed that cows experiencing SARA and challenged intramammarily with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) experienced stronger metabolic disturbances compared with cows without SARA. Therefore, we hypothesized that cows experiencing SARA have a modulated innate immune response and impaired plasma metabolome compared with healthy cows when experiencing an acute mastitis challenge. A total of 18 Simmental cows were subjected either to a Control (CON, n =6) or SARA ( n= 12) feeding regimen, receiving either 40% or 60% concentrates for 30 days. Thereafter, six SARA (SARA-LPS) and the CON (CON-LPS) cows were intramammarily challenged with 50 µg LPS from Escherichia coli (O26 : B6), while the remaining six SARA cows (SARA-PLA) received a placebo. Blood and milk samples were analyzed for acute phase proteins and a targeted ESI-LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics approach was performed in blood samples 24 h after the LPS challenge. The LPS infusion caused a strong increase in immune response variables, with a higher concentration of milk amyloid A 48 h after the LPS challenge in SARA-LPS compared with CON-LPS cows. Cows receiving the LPS infusion had a lower plasma concentration of several amino acids and lysophosphatidylcholines but without differences in SARA cows and healthy cows. In conclusion, our results revealed that an intramammary LPS infusion increased acute phase proteins and modulated the blood metabolome. While no systemic differences between SARA and healthy cows were observed, cows experiencing SARA showed a higher concentration of an acute phase protein at the local level of the mammary gland. Further research is required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to evaluate its clinical significance for udder health.","author":[{"family":"Humer","given":"E."},{"family":"Aditya","given":"S."},{"family":"Zebeli","given":"Q."}],"citation-key":"Humer2018","container-title":"Animal","DOI":"10.1017/S1751731118000411","ISSN":"1751-7311","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"1-10","title":"Innate immunity and metabolomic responses in dairy cows challenged intramammarily with lipopolysaccharide after subacute ruminal acidosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1751731118000411/type/journal_article"},

We recently showed that supplementation with phytogenic compounds (PHY) or autolyzed yeast (AY) counteracted negative effects of SARA by improving ruminal pH and microbiome. This study investigated the effects of an intermittent SARA challenge on the ruminal concentration of biogenic amines (BA) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), as well as on the blood metabolome. We also evaluated effects of PHY and AY on the latter variables. Eight rumen-cannulated nonlactating Holstein cows were arranged in an incomplete 4 × 3 Latin square design with 4 experimental runs and 3 treatment groups. During each run, cows were switched from an all-forage diet (baseline) to an intermittent concentrate-challenge diet with a forage:concentrate ratio of 35:65 (dry matter basis) to induce SARA for 1 (SARA1) or 2 (SARA2) wk, separated by 1 wk of forage-only feeding. The 3 treatment groups were no additive as control, PHY, or AY. During baseline, SARA1 and SARA2 rumen fluid samples were collected for analysis of BA and LPS. Blood samples were taken during baseline and SARA1 for a targeted metabolomics approach. High-concentrate feeding caused a 9-fold increase in ruminal LPS during SARA1 and an 11-fold increase in SARA2 compared with the baseline. Elevated concentrations of ruminal BA were found during both SARA periods, with histamine showing the strongest increase during SARA1. Moreover, a decrease in phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelines, and several AA in the blood during SARA1 were detected. Supplementation of PHY decreased concentrations of LPS (-43%), histamine (-66%), pyrrolidine (-38%), and spermine (-54%) in SARA1 and cadaverine in SARA2 (-50%). Moreover, cows that received PHY had higher concentrations of cholesterol (+26%), several AA, and phosphatidylcholines in SARA1 compared with control cows. For AY, decreases in ruminal ethanolamine (-21%), methylamine (-52%), histamine (-54%), spermidine (-44%), and spermine (-80%) in SARA1 were observed, whereas in the blood an increase in tryptophan was noticed. In conclusion, the SARA was associated with markedly increased concentrations of LPS and BA in the rumen fluid and undesirable shifts in the plasma metabolome. Supplementation of PHY and AY counteracted some of these changes and therefore may help in attenuating negative effects of high-concentrate feeding in dairy cattle.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Humer","given":"E"},{"family":"Kröger","given":"I"},{"family":"Neubauer","given":"V"},{"family":"Schedle","given":"K"},{"family":"Reisinger","given":"N"},{"family":"Zebeli","given":"Q"}],"citation-key":"humer2018","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2018-14744","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,1]]},"page":"9559-9574","PMID":"30031584","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Supplementing phytogenic compounds or autolyzed yeast modulates ruminal biogenic amines and plasma metabolome in dry cows experiencing subacute ruminal acidosis.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30031584","volume":"101"},
  {"id":"Humer2019","abstract":"After parturition, cows undergo negative energy balance leading to fat mobilization, predisposing them to fatty liver syndrome and ketosis with major consequences for health and reproduction. Supplementation of rumen-protected choline (RPC) has attracted major research efforts during the last decade, assuming that choline improves liver function by increasing very low-density lipoprotein exportation from the liver, thereby improving metabolic profiles, milk production, and reproduction. However, the effects of RPC on production, health, and reproduction have been inconsistent. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of RPC supplementation, starting from d 20 (± 12.2) ante partum to d 53 (± 31.0) postpartum, on feed intake, milk production performance and metabolic profiles of dairy cows early postpartum. Data analyses from 27 published studies showed an increase in postpartal dry matter intake (from on average 19.1 to 19.9 kg/d; p < 0.01) and milk yield (from on average 31.8 to 32.9 kg/d; p = 0.03) in cows receiving RPC. Milk fat yield and milk protein yield were also increased (p ≤ 0.05), without changing milk protein and fat contents. However, no interactive effects between cow’s milk yield level and RPC-supplementation as well as no dose-dependent effects of RPC supplementation were observed. Supplementing the diet with RPC showed no effects on blood metabolites (non-esterified fatty acids, beta-hydroxybutyrate, glucose, and cholesterol), independent of the milk yield level of the cows. An effect on liver triacylglycerol contents, incidence of ketosis, and mastitis could not be confirmed across all studies included in this meta-analysis. Also, the positive effects of RPC supplementation on reproductive performance were not consistent findings. In conclusion, supplementing RPC in lactating dairy cows showed positive effects on dry matter intake which likely caused the improved milk yield. However, RPC supplementation did not improve the metabolic health status of the cows. As several factors might be related to the responses to RPC, further research is needed to explore the precise mechanisms of RPC action in lactating cows, especially with regards to feed intake improvement and its related metabolic health-promoting potential in early lactating dairy cows.","author":[{"family":"Humer","given":"Elke"},{"family":"Bruggeman","given":"Geert"},{"family":"Zebeli","given":"Qendrim"}],"citation-key":"Humer2019","container-title":"Animals","DOI":"10.3390/ani9080566","ISBN":"4312507732","ISSN":"20762615","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"title":"A meta-analysis on the impact of the supplementation of rumen-protected choline on the metabolic health and performance of dairy cattle","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

Initially, 2 groups were assigned to a headlock barrier, and 2 groups to a post-and-rail barrier.

After these periods, the feed barriers were switched between groups and the 4 stocking density treatments were readministered. Time-lapse video was used to quantify feeding, standing, and aggressive behavior at the feed bunk. Daily feeding times were greater and duration of inactive standing in the feeding area was less when using a post-and-rail compared with a headlock feed barrier. Feeding time decreased and inactive standing increased for both barrier designs as stocking density increased at the feed bunk. Cows were displaced more often from the feeding area when the stocking density was increased, and this effect was greater for cows using the post-and-rail feed barrier. Cows ranked lower in the social hierarchy at the feed bunk were displaced more often when feeding at a post-and-rail barrier, particularly at high stocking densities. Therefore, we recommend avoiding overstocking at the feed bunk to increase feeding activity and reduce competition. Use of a barrier that provides some physical separation between adjacent cows, such as a headlock feed barrier, can be used to further reduce competition at the feed bunk.","author":[{"family":"Huzzey","given":"J.M."},{"family":"DeVries","given":"T.J."},{"family":"Valois","given":"P."},{"family":"Keyserlingk","given":"M.A.G.","non-dropping-particle":"von"}],"citation-key":"Huzzey2006","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72075-6","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"page":"126-133","PMID":"16357274","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Stocking Density and Feed Barrier Design Affect the Feeding and Social Behavior of Dairy Cattle","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030206720756","volume":"89"},

Two stocking density treatments (control: one headlock and lying stall per cow; overstocked: 0.5 headlocks and 0.5 lying stalls per cow) and two diet treatments (control: no added supplement; and OG: 56 g/cow per day) were investigated. Four pens of 15 cows were fed their assigned diet (two pens per diet; control stocking density) for 45 days after which each stocking density treatment was applied for a 14 day period using a cross-over design; this study design was replicated twice. During each 14 day period, blood was collected on day four to measure whole blood leukocyte messenger RNA abundance (cluster of differentiation 80, interleukin 8 receptor-beta, interleukin 10 receptor-beta and L-selectin) and fecal samples were collected every two days to measure fecal cortisol metabolite concentration (11,17-dioxoandrostanes). At the end of each 14 day period, eight cows from each pen were selected for an intravenous glucose tolerance test; glucose, insulin and nonesterified fatty acids were measured. There were no effects of diet or stocking density on leukocyte messenger RNA abundance. Fecal cortisol metabolite concentrations were highest for overstocked cows on the control diet on day four of the stocking density treatment, however, by day 10, overstocked cows fed OG had the highest fecal cortisol metabolite concentrations. Overstocked cows, regardless of diet, had an attenuated insulin response during the glucose tolerance test, represented by a lower area under the curve estimate. Cows fed OG but not overstocked, had a lower nonesterified fatty acid nadir during the glucose challenge, compared to all the other treatments. In conclusion, overstocking prompts a physiological stress response and alters energy metabolism by decreasing the insulin response to an intravenous glucose challenge. Feeding OG during overstocking delayed the increase in fecal cortisol metabolites by several days, however it is unclear if this altered glucocorticoid response benefited the cow, as OG had no effect on insulin responses or immune parameters.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Huzzey","given":"J.

  {"id":"Hymøller2014","abstract":"<p>Starch is an important energy-providing nutrient for dairy cows that is most commonly provided from cereal grains. However, ruminal fermentation of large amounts of easily degradable starch leads to excessive production and accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFA). VFA not only play a vital role in the energy metabolism of dairy cows but are also the main cause of ruminal acidosis and depressed feed intake. The aim of the present study was to compare maize cob silage (MCS) as an energy supplement in rations for dairy cows with highly rumen-digestible rolled barley and with sodium hydroxide wheat (SHW), which has a higher proportion of by-pass starch than barley. Two studies were carried out: (1) a production study on 45 Danish Holstein cows and (2) an intensive study to determine digestibilities, rumen fermentation patterns and methane emission using three rumen-cannulated Danish Holstein cows. Both studies were organised as a 3×3 Latin square with three experimental periods and three different mixed rations. The rations consisted of grass-clover silage and maize silage (~60% of dry matter (DM)), rapeseed cake, soybean meal, sugar beet pulp and one of three different cereals as a major energy supplement: MCS, SHW or rolled barley (~25% of DM). When MCS replaced barley or SHW as an energy supplement in the mixed rations, it resulted in a lower dry matter intake; however, the apparent total tract digestibilities of DM, organic matter, NDF, starch and protein were not different between treatments. The energy-corrected milk yield was unaffected by treatment. The fat content of the milk on the MCS ration was not different from the SHW ration, whereas it was higher on the barley ration. The protein content of the milk decreased when MCS was used in the ration compared with barley and SHW. From ruminal VFA patterns and pH measures, it appeared that MCS possessed roughage qualities with respect to rumen environment, while at the same time being sufficiently energy rich to replace barley and SHW as a major energy supplement for milk production. The environmental impact, expressed as methane emissions, was not different when comparing MCS, SHW and barley.</p>","author":[{"family":"Hymøller","given":"L."},{"family":"Hellwing","given":"A.

  {"id":"Ibanez-Escriche2009","abstract":"BACKGROUND: One of the main limitations of many livestock breeding programs is that selection is in pure breeds housed in high-health environments but the aim is to improve crossbred performance under field conditions. Genomic selection (GS) using high-density genotyping could be used to address this. However in crossbred populations, 1) effects of SNPs may be breed specific, and 2) linkage disequilibrium may not be restricted to markers that are tightly linked to the QTL. In this study we apply GS to select for commercial crossbred performance and compare a model with breed-specific effects of SNP alleles (BSAM) to a model where SNP effects are assumed the same across breeds (ASGM). The impact of breed relatedness (generations since separation), size of the population used for training, and marker density were evaluated. Trait phenotype was controlled by 30 QTL and had a heritability of 0.30 for crossbred individuals. A Bayesian method (Bayes-B) was used to estimate the SNP effects in the crossbred training population and the accuracy of resulting GS breeding values for commercial crossbred performance was validated in the purebred population.\n\nRESULTS: Results demonstrate that crossbred data can be used to evaluate purebreds for commercial crossbred performance. Accuracies based on crossbred data were generally not much lower than accuracies based on pure breed data and almost identical when the breeds crossed were closely related breeds. The accuracy of both models (ASGM and BSAM) increased with marker density and size of the training data. Accuracies of both models also tended to decrease with increasing distance between breeds. However the effect of marker density, training data size and distance between breeds differed between the two models. BSAM only performed better than AGSM when the number of markers was small (500), the number of records used for training was large (4000), and when breeds were distantly related or unrelated.\n\nCONCLUSION: In conclusion, GS can be conducted in crossbred population and models that fit breed-specific effects of SNP alleles may not be necessary, especially with high marker density. This opens great opportunities for genetic improvement of purebreds for performance of their crossbred descendents in the field, without the need to track pedigrees through the system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Ibánez-Escriche","given":"Noelia"},{"family":"Fernando","given":"Rohan L"},{"family":"Toosi","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Dekkers","given":"Jack C M"}],"citation-key":"Ibanez-Escriche2009","container-title":"Genetics, selection, evolution : GSE","DOI":"10.1186/1297-9686-41-12","ISSN":"1297-9686","issue":"4000","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",1]]},"page":"12","PMID":"19284703","title":"Genomic selection of purebreds for crossbred performance.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2730054&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"Imani2017","abstract":"A meta-analysis of the potential effect of forage provision on growth performance and rumen fermentation of dairy calves was conducted using published data from the literature (1998–2016). Meta-regression was used to evaluate the effects of different forage levels, forage sources, forage offering methods, physical forms of starter, and grain sources on the heterogeneity of the results. We considered 27 studies that reported the effects of forage provision to dairy calves. Estimated effect sizes of forage were calculated on starter feed intake, average daily gain (ADG), feed efficiency (FE), body weight (BW), and rumen fermentation parameters. Intake of starter feed, ADG, BW, ruminal pH, and rumen molar proportion of acetate increased when supplementing forage but FE decreased. Heterogeneity (the amount of variation among studies) was significant for intake of starter feed, ADG, FE, final BW, and rumen fermentation parameters. Improving overall starter feed intake was greater in calves offered alfalfa hay compared with those offered other types of forages. During the milk feeding and overall periods, improving ADG was greater for calves fed a high level of forage (>10% in dry matter) compared with those fed a low level of forage (≤10% in dry matter) diets. The advantages reported in weight gain at a high level of forage could be due to increased gut fill. Improving overall ADG was lower for calves offered forages with textured starter feed compared with ground starter feed. The meta-regression analysis revealed that changes associated with forage provision affect FE differently for various forage sources and forage offering methods during the milk-feeding period. Forage sources also modulated the effect of feeding forage on ruminal pH during the milk-feeding period. In conclusion, forage has the potential to affect starter feed intake and performance of dairy calves, but its effects depend on source, level, and method of forage feeding and physical form of starter feed independently of grain sources included in the starter feed.","author":[{"family":"Imani","given":"M."},{"family":"Mirzaei","given":"M."},{"family":"Baghbanzadeh-Nobari","given":"B."},{"family":"Ghaffari","given":"M.H."}],"citation-key":"Imani2017","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2016-11561","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"1136-1150","PMID":"27939538","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Effects of forage provision to dairy calves on growth performance and rumen fermentation: A meta-analysis and meta-regression","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030216308438","volume":"100"},
  {"id":"immlerAssociationsMetabolicStatus2021","abstract":"Supplying newborn calves with immunoglobins is critical for their health and a daily challenge in the dairy industry. Among various factors determining colostrum quality, the prepartum metabolic status of the cow might be of particular importance. The objective of this observational cross-sectional study was to evaluate relationships between cow-level variables and the colostrum quality as determined by Brix refractometry. A total of 873 cows of varying breed and parity from 124 German dairy herds were included in the study, and blood and urine samples were taken 3 to 1 wk before the expected calving date. Effectively, samples were collected on average 8.2 d (geometric mean) before calving, ranging from 2 to 45 d. The final variable set included body condition score, lameness score, breed, parity, vaccination of the cow, the activity of glutamate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase, the urine concentration of creatinine, net acid-base excretion, the serum concentration of cholesterol and calcium, and the difference in albumin and total protein concentration. Generalized linear mixed effects regression models with hierarchically structured random effects (cow within herd) using the maximum likelihood method were fitted to the data to identify associations between the Brix value as an outcome and cow-level variables as predictors. Cows entering second parity had lower Brix values compared with cows entering third or greater parity, and prepartum vaccination of cows led to higher Brix values compared with nonvaccinated cows. Cows with a moderate to high lameness score had lower Brix values than cows with low-grade lameness. An increase of glutamate dehydrogenase serum activity and serum calcium concentration were associated with lower Brix values, whereas an increase in the difference of total protein and albumin serum concentration led to higher Brix values. In conclusion, the metabolic health of the cow affects colostrum quality and may cause failure of passive immunoglobulin transfer as well as impaired calf health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Immler","given":"Manuela"},{"family":"Failing","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Gärtner","given":"Tanja"},{"family":"Wehrend","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Donat","given":"Karsten"}],"citation-key":"immlerAssociationsMetabolicStatus2021","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/JDS.2020-19812","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,1]]},"page":"10131-10142","PMID":"34253369","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Associations between the metabolic status of the cow and colostrum quality as determined by Brix refractometry","type":"article-journal","volume":"104"},

Experimental diets contained 36 and 30% corn silage, 18 and 15% grass silage, and 46 and 55% concentrates, respectively, for low starch and high starch diets, on a dry matter (DM) basis. Butyrate was provided as Gustor BP70 WS (Norel S.A., Madrid, Spain), containing 70% sodium butyrate and 30% fatty acid mixture, at 2% of dietary DM (providing butyrate at 1.1% of dietary DM), and control premix contained 70% wheat bran and 30% fatty acid mixture. Interaction effects between dietary starch content and butyrate supplementation were not observed for primary response variables, and milk yield was not affected by treatment. Butyrate supplementation increased serum β-hydroxybutyrate concentration compared with control (0.706 vs. 0.930 m<i>M</i>), but did not exceed 1.2 m<i>M</i>, a commonly accepted value for subclinical ketosis, and DMI was not affected. Cows fed butyrate had increased milk fat content (4.58 vs. 4.37%) and milk fat yield (1.51 vs. 1.42 kg/d), tended to have increased 4% fat-corrected milk yield (35.9 vs. 34.3 kg/d) and feed efficiency (1.56 vs. 1.50; 4% fat-corrected milk yield/DMI), and had decreased milk urea nitrogen (MUN) concentration (10.8 vs. 11.7 mg/dL) compared with control. Cows fed high starch diets tended to have increased DMI (23.3 vs. 22.5 kg/d), increased milk protein yield (1.13 vs. 1.05 kg/d), and decreased MUN concentration (10.3 vs. 12.2 mg/dL). Inclusion of butyrate at 1.1% of dietary DM increased milk fat production and decreased MUN concentration without affecting DMI or increasing the risk of subclinical ketosis, regardless of dietary starch content.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Izumi","given":"K."},{"family":"Fukumori","given":"R."},{"family":"Oikawa","given":"S."},{"family":"Oba","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"izumi2019","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/JDS.2019-17113","ISBN":"102:1105111056","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,1]]},"page":"11051-11056","PMID":"31629511","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Short communication: Effects of butyrate supplementation on the productivity of lactating dairy cows fed diets differing in starch content","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030219309270/fulltext","volume":"102"},
  {"id":"Jaakkola2006","abstract":"The study was conducted to evaluate the effects of silage fermentation quality and type of supplementation on milk production. Thirty two Finnish Ayrshire dairy cows were used in a cyclic change-over experiment with four 21-day experimental periods and 4×2×2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Silage fermentation was modified with formic acid (FA), which was applied at the rates equivalent to 0 (FA0), 2 (FA2), 4 (FA4) or 6 (FA6) litres t-1 grass of pure formic acid (as 100% FA). Dietary treatments consisted of four silages, a protein supplementation (no supplement or rapeseed meal 1.8 kg d-1) and a glucogenic substrate (no supplement or propylene glycol 225 g d -1). Increasing the application rate of FA restricted silage fermentation curvilinearly, as evidenced by higher concentrations of ammonia N and butyric acid in FA4 than FA2 silage. Similarly the use of FA resulted in curvilinear changes in the silage dry matter intake and milk yield. The highest milk and protein yields were achieved with FA6, while the milk yield with FA2 was higher than with FA4. Interactions were observed between silage type and supplementation. Rapeseed meal increased milk yield irrespective of the extent of silage fermentation, but the magnitude of response was variable. Propylene glycol was most beneficial with restrictively fermented silages FA4 and FA6. In conclusion, restriction of silage fermentation with a high rate of formic acid is beneficial in milk production. Interactions between silage composition and concentrate types suggest that the responses to supplementary feeding depend on silage fermentation characteristics. © Agricultural and Food Science.","author":[{"family":"Jaakkola","given":"Seija"},{"family":"Rinne","given":"Marketta"},{"family":"Heikkilä","given":"Terttu"},{"family":"Toivonen","given":"Vesa"},{"family":"Huhtanen","given":"Pekka"}],"citation-key":"Jaakkola2006","container-title":"Agricultural and Food Science","DOI":"10.2137/145960606779216290","ISBN":"1459606067792","ISSN":"14596067","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"page":"200-218","title":"Effects of restriction of silage fermentation with formic acid on milk production","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

Holstein calves (n = 48, 24 males) were blocked at 56 to 70 d after birth (80+/-10 kg of body weight) according to sex and birth date and assigned randomly in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement of dietary treatments containing cation-anion differences as meq (Na + K) - (Cl + S)/kg of diet dry matter and Ca content of 1) 0 and 0.35%, 2) 0 and 0.50%, 3) 0 and 0.65%, 4) 200 and 0.35%, 5) 200 and 0.50%, and 6) 200 and 0.65%. Feed intake and average daily gain did not differ among treatment groups. Plasma pH and Ca were unaffected by dietary Ca content or dietary cation-anion difference. Plasma Cl and P decreased linearly with increasing Ca content in the diet. Plasma HCO3 increased linearly with increased dietary Ca content. Plasma HCO3 and partial pressure of CO2 were higher in calves fed the 200 compared with calves fed the 0 cation-anion difference diets. Plasma Cl was, however, lower in calves fed the 200 compared with calves fed the 0 meq diets. An interaction of Ca content and dietary cation-anion difference was detected for plasma P content. Urinary pH increased linearly with increasing dietary Ca content. Calves fed the 200 meq dietary cation-anion difference had higher urinary pH values than those fed the 0 meq diet. Urinary P excretion was not altered by dietary cation-anion difference or Ca content of the diet. Calves fed the 0 meq diet had higher urinary cocnentrations of Ca and Cl when compared with those fed the 200 meq diet. Bone ash, P, Ca, Mg, and K content of the 10th rib were not affected by dietary treatments. Breaking strength of the seventh and ninth ribs increased quadratically with increasing dietary Ca content. Dietary cation-anion difference had no effect on the breaking strength of the seventh and ninth ribs.

  {"id":"Jacobs2017","abstract":"Digital dermatitis (DD) is the most prevalent foot lesion affecting dairy herds worldwide. Its implications include production losses and decreased animal welfare. Footbathing is the most common herd-level prevention strategy for DD. Because many common footbath products have negative environmental and health consequences, replacement products expected to have improved safety but equal efficacy are being developed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a new quaternary ammonium-based commercial footbath product (QAC) for reducing the prevalence of active DD lesions compared with an industry standard (copper sulfate; CuSO4) and typical on-farm footbath practices. A controlled intervention trial was conducted on 19 Alberta dairy farms over 12 wk, with 9 farms allocated to the QAC group (1% QAC daily, 5 d/wk), 5 to the CuSO4 group (5% CuSO4 daily, 5 d/wk), and 5 to a noninterference group (maintained typical footbath practices). A total of 22,285 observations on 3,465 lactating cows were assessed for DD lesions and leg cleanliness in the milking parlor. Five farms discontinued use of the QAC product for various reasons. Noninferiority analysis was used to assess QAC ability to decrease the proportion of cows with 1 or more active DD lesions compared with CuSO4 after 6 wk. Multilevel logistic regression models for repeated measures were used to evaluate efficacy of QAC compared with CuSO4 and noninterference farms in reducing the prevalence of active DD lesions at the foot level over 12 wk. The noninferiority analysis determined that the proportion of cows with 1 or more active DD lesion decreased 2.19 (95% CI: 1.39-3.46) times less after 6 wk of study on the QAC farms compared with CuSO4 farms, making QAC inferior to CuSO4. The multilevel logistic regression models determined that the proportion of active DD lesions increased in the QAC herds, whereas this proportion decreased in the CuSO4 and noninterference herds over 12 wk. Additionally, cows in mid- and late-lactation had a higher odds of having active DD compared with fresh cows. Older cows (parity 3 and ≥4) had a decreased odds of active DD compared with first-parity cows. At the farm level, a higher baseline active DD prevalence resulted in increased odds of active DD; however, this did not modify the effect of treatment or week of study. We concluded that QAC was inferior to CuSO4 and typical on-farm footbath practices, and further development of novel footbath products is required to develop an ideal alternative.","author":[{"family":"Jacobs","given":"C."},{"family":"Orsel","given":"K."},{"family":"Mason","given":"S."},{"family":"Gray","given":"K."},{"family":"Barkema","given":"H.W."}],"citation-key":"Jacobs2017","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2016-12257","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"5628-5641","PMID":"28478000","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Comparison of the efficacy of a commercial footbath product with copper sulfate for the control of digital dermatitis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030217303776","volume":"100"},

Ultimately, declining vitamin D levels in dairy products will mean that dairy products are a negligible source of natural vitamin D for humans. We tested the ability of a specially designed UVB lamp to enhance the vitamin D3 content in milk from dairy cows housed indoors. This study included 16 cows divided into 4 groups. Each group was exposed daily to artificial UVB light simulating 1, 2, 3, or 4 h of summer sun at 56°N for 24 d, and the group with simulated exposure to 2 h of summer sun daily continued to be monitored for 73 d. We found a significant increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3) levels in plasma as well as vitamin D3 and 25OHD3 levels in milk after daily exposure for 24 d in all treatment groups. Extending daily exposure to artificial UVB light to 73 d did not lead to an increase of vitamin D3 or 25OHD3 level in the milk. In conclusion, the change in production facilities for dairy cows providing cows with no access to pasture and sunlight causes a decrease of vitamin D levels in dairy products. This decrease may be prevented by exposing cows to artificial UVB light in the stable.","author":[{"family":"Jakobsen","given":"Jette"},{"family":"Jensen","given":"Søren Krogh"},{"family":"Hymøller","given":"Lone"},{"family":"Andersen","given":"Elisabeth Wreford"},{"family":"Kaas","given":"Poul"},{"family":"Burild","given":"Anders"},{"family":"Jäpelt","given":"Rie Bak"}],"citation-key":"Jakobsen2015","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2014-9277","ISSN":"15253198","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"6492-6498","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Short communication: Artificial ultraviolet B light exposure increases vitamin D levels in cow plasma and milk","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2014-9277","volume":"98"},

Traits covered a wide spectrum of aspects related to reproductive performance of dairy cows. Other frequently used fertility characteristics, like days open or calving intervals, could easily be derived from the analyzed traits. Data included 94,250 records in parities 1 to 6 on 53,158 cows from Ontario and Quebec, born in the years 1997 to 2002. Reproductive characteristics of heifers and cows were treated as different but genetically correlated traits that gave 16 total traits in the analysis. Repeated records for later parities were modeled with permanent environmental effects. Direct and maternal genetic effects were included in linear models for traits related to calving performance. Bayesian methods with Gibbs sampling were used to estimate covariance components of the model and respective genetic parameters. Estimates of heritabilities for fertility traits were low, from 3% for nonreturn rate in heifers to 13% for age at first service. Interval traits had higher heritabilities than binary or categorical traits. Service sire, sire of calf, and artificial insemination technician were important (relative to additive genetic) sources of variation for nonreturn rate and traits related to calving performance. Fertility traits in heifers and older cows were not the same genetically (genetic correlations in general were smaller than 0.9). Genetic correlations (both direct and maternal) among traits indicated that different traits measured different aspects of reproductive performance of a dairy cow. These traits could be used jointly in a fertility index to allow for selection for better fertility of dairy cattle.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Jamrozik","given":"J"},{"family":"Fatehi","given":"J"},{"family":"Kistemaker","given":"G J"},{"family":"Schaeffer","given":"L R"}],"citation-key":"Jamrozik2005","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)72895-2","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",6]]},"page":"2199-208","PMID":"15905449","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Estimates of genetic parameters for Canadian Holstein female reproduction traits.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15905449","volume":"88"},

Primiparous (n=24) and multiparous (n=23) Holsteins were randomly assigned by expected date of parturition to 1 of 3 prepartum energy intakes. A moderate energy diet [1.63 Mcal of net energy for lactation (NE(L))/kg; 15% crude protein (CP)] was fed for either ad libitum intake (OVR) or restricted intake (RES) to supply 150 or 80% of National Research Council (2001) energy requirement, respectively, for dry cows in late gestation. To limit energy intake to 100% of NRC requirement at ad libitum dry matter intake (DMI), chopped wheat straw was included as 31.8% of dry matter (DM) in a control diet (CON; 1.21 Mcal of NE(L)/kg of DM; 14% CP). Multiparous and primiparous cows assigned to OVR gained body condition during the dry period [initial body condition score (BCS)=3.3], but were not overconditioned by parturition (BCS=3.5). Multiparous cows in the OVR group lost more BCS postpartum than multiparous RES or CON cows. Primiparous cows lost similar amounts of BCS among dietary treatment groups postpartum. Addition of chopped wheat straw to CON diets prevented a large decrease in DMI prepartum in both primiparous and multiparous cows. During the first 3 wk postpartum, DMI as a percentage of BW was lower for multiparous OVR cows than for multiparous RES cows. Prepartum diet effects did not carry over through the entire 8-wk lactation period. Because of greater mobilization of body stores, OVR cows had greater milk fat percentage and greater 3.5% fat-corrected milk yield during the first 3 wk postpartum. Multiparous cows assigned to OVR experienced a 55% decrease in energy balance and primiparous cows a 40% decrease in energy balance during the last 3 wk before parturition, compared with CON or RES cows that had little change. Multiparous cows fed OVR had a greater contribution of energy from body energy reserves to milk energy output than either CON or RES cows. Overfeeding energy prepartum resulted in large changes in periparturient energy balance. Even in the absence of overconditioning, a large change in DMI and energy balance prepartum influenced postpartum DMI and BCS loss, especially for multiparous cows. Chopped wheat straw was effective at controlling energy intake prepartum, although primiparous cows did not achieve predicted DMI. Even so, controlling or restricting energy intake in primiparous cows was not detrimental to lactational performance over the first 8 wk of lactation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Janovick","given":"N","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Drackley","given":"J K"}],"citation-key":"Janovick2010","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2009-2656","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",7]]},"page":"3086-102","PMID":"20630227","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Prepartum dietary management of energy intake affects postpartum intake and lactation performance by primiparous and multiparous Holstein cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20630227","volume":"93"},

  {"id":"Japelt2013","abstract":"The major function of vitamin D in vertebrates is maintenance of calcium homeostasis, but vitamin D insufficiency has also been linked to an increased risk of hypertension, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Therefore, there is a growing awareness about vitamin D as a requirement for optimal health. Vitamin D3 is synthesized in the skin by a photochemical conversion of provitamin D3, but the necessary rays are only emitted all year round in places that lie below a 35° latitude. Unfortunately, very few food sources naturally contain vitamin D and the general population as a results fail to meet the requirements. Fish have the highest natural content of vitamin D expected to derive from an accumulation in the food chain originating from microalgae. Microalgae contain both vitamin D3 and provitamin D3, which suggests that vitamin D3 exist in the plant kingdom and vitamin D3 has also been identified in several plant species as a surprise to many. The term vitamin D also includes vitamin D2 that is produced in fungi and yeasts by UVB-exposure of provitamin D2. Small amounts can be found in plants contaminated with fungi and traditionally only vitamin D2 has been considered present in plants. This review summarizes the current knowledge on sterol biosynthesis leading to provitamin D.

  {"id":"Javierre2010","abstract":"Monozygotic (MZ) twins are partially concordant for most complex diseases, including autoimmune disorders. Whereas phenotypic concordance can be used to study heritability, discordance suggests the role of non-genetic factors. In autoimmune diseases, environmentally driven epigenetic changes are thought to contribute to their etiology. Here we report the first high-throughput and candidate sequence analyses of DNA methylation to investigate discordance for autoimmune disease in twins. We used a cohort of MZ twins discordant for three diseases whose clinical signs often overlap: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and dermatomyositis. Only MZ twins discordant for SLE featured widespread changes in the DNA methylation status of a significant number of genes. Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment in categories associated with immune function. Individual analysis confirmed the existence of DNA methylation and expression changes in genes relevant to SLE pathogenesis. These changes occurred in parallel with a global decrease in the 5-methylcytosine content that was concomitantly accompanied with changes in DNA methylation and expression levels of ribosomal RNA genes, although no changes in repetitive sequences were found. Our findings not only identify potentially relevant DNA methylation markers for the clinical characterization of SLE patients but also support the notion that epigenetic changes may be critical in the clinical manifestations of autoimmune disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Javierre","given":"Biola M"},{"family":"Fernandez","given":"Agustin F"},{"family":"Richter","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Al-Shahrour","given":"Fatima"},{"family":"Martin-Subero","given":"J Ignacio"},{"family":"Rodriguez-Ubreva","given":"Javier"},{"family":"Berdasco","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Fraga","given":"Mario F"},{"family":"O'Hanlon","given":"Terrance P"},{"family":"Rider","given":"Lisa G"},{"family":"Jacinto","given":"Filipe V"},{"family":"Lopez-Longo","given":"F Javier"},{"family":"Dopazo","given":"Joaquin"},{"family":"Forn","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Peinado","given":"Miguel","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Carreño","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Sawalha","given":"Amr H"},{"family":"Harley","given":"John B"},{"family":"Siebert","given":"Reiner"},{"family":"Esteller","given":"Manel"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Frederick W"},{"family":"Ballestar","given":"Esteban"}],"citation-key":"Javierre2010","container-title":"Genome research","DOI":"10.1101/gr.100289.109","ISSN":"1549-5469","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",2]]},"page":"170-9","PMID":"20028698","title":"Changes in the pattern of DNA methylation associate with twin discordance in systemic lupus erythematosus.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2813473&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","volume":"20"},
  {"id":"Jenkins2014","abstract":"A recent study reported a 0.4 percentage unit increase in milk fat of lactating dairy cattle when dietary K was increased from 1.2 to 2% with potassium carbonate. Because milk fat yield has been associated with ruminal production of certain conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers, 2 studies were conducted to determine if increasing potassium carbonate in the rumen would alter patterns of fermentation and biohydrogenation. In experiment 1, 5 dual-flow continuous fermenters were injected just before each feeding with a 10% (wt/wt) stock potassium carbonate solution to provide the equivalent of 1.1 (K1), 2.2 (K2), and 3.3 (K3) % of diet dry matter (DM) as added K. One of the remaining fermenters received no K (K0) and the last fermenter (NaOH) was injected with adequate NaOH stock solution (10%, wt/wt) to match the pH observed for the K3 treatment. For experiment 2, 6 dual-flow continuous fermenters were used to evaluate 6 treatments arranged in a 2×3 factorial to examine 2 levels of soybean oil (0 and 3.64% of diet DM) and added K at 0, 1.6, and 3.3% of diet DM. In both experiments, fermenters were fed 55 to 57g of DM/d of a typical dairy diet consisting of 1:1 forage (10% alfalfa hay and 90% corn silage) to concentrate mix in 2 equal portions at 0800 and 1630h, and fed the respective diets for 10-d periods. Potassium carbonate addition increased pH in both experiments. Acetate:propionate ratio and pH in experiment 1 increased linearly for K0 to K3. Acetate:propionate ratio was lower for NaOH compared with K3 but the pH was the same. The trans-11 18:1 and cis-9,trans-11 CLA production rates (mg/d) increased linearly from K0 to K3, but K3 and NaOH did not differ. Production of trans-10 18:1 decreased and that of trans-10,cis-12 tended to decrease from K0 to K3, but production of trans-10,cis-12 CLA remained high for NaOH. Addition of K to the cultures in experiment 2 decreased propionate and increased acetate and acetate:propionate ratio for the 0% fat diet but not for the 3.64% fat diet. Addition of K increased stearic acid and cis-9,trans-11 CLA but decreased daily production of trans-10 C18:1 and trans-10,cis-12 CLA. The results indicate that increasing potassium carbonate in the diet shifts both fermentation and biohydrogenation pathways toward higher milk fat percentage in dairy cows, but the effects are only explained in part by elevation of pH.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",1,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Jenkins","given":"T C"},{"family":"Bridges","given":"W C"},{"family":"Harrison","given":"J H"},{"family":"Young","given":"K M"}],"citation-key":"Jenkins2014","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2013-7164","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",2]]},"page":"975-84","PMID":"24359822","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Addition of potassium carbonate to continuous cultures of mixed ruminal bacteria shifts volatile fatty acids and daily production of biohydrogenation intermediates.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24359822","volume":"97"},

  {"id":"jeon2018","abstract":"Vitamin D, traditionally known as an essential nutrient, is a precursor of a potent steroid hormone that regulates a broad spectrum of physiological processes. In addition to its classical roles in bone metabolism, epidemiological, preclinical, and cellular research during the last decades, it revealed that vitamin D may play a key role in the prevention and treatment of many extra-skeletal diseases such as cancer. Vitamin D, as a prohormone, undergoes two-step metabolism in liver and kidney to produce a biologically active metabolite, calcitriol, which binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) for the regulation of expression of diverse genes. In addition, recent studies have revealed that vitamin D can also be metabolized and activated through a CYP11A1-driven non-canonical metabolic pathway. Numerous anticancer properties of vitamin D have been proposed, with diverse effects on cancer development and progression. However, accumulating data suggest that the metabolism and functions of vitamin D are dysregulated in many types of cancer, conferring resistance to the antitumorigenic effects of vitamin D and thereby contributing to the development and progression of cancer. Thus, understanding dysregulated vitamin D metabolism and function in cancer will be critical for the development of promising new strategies for successful vitamin D-based cancer therapy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Jeon","given":"Sang-Min"},{"family":"Shin","given":"Eun-Ae"}],"citation-key":"jeon2018","container-title":"Experimental & Molecular Medicine","container-title-short":"Exp Mol Med","DOI":"10.1038/s12276-018-0038-9","ISSN":"2092-6413","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4]]},"language":"en","license":"2018 The Author(s)","number":"4","page":"1-14","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Exploring vitamin D metabolism and function in cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s12276-018-0038-9","volume":"50"},

  {"id":"Ji2015","abstract":"Two independent studies were conducted to determine whether mechanical mixing of total mixed ration (TMR) or TMR dry matter alters Lys release from 6 rumen-protected Lys (RPL) products (A, B, C, D, E, and F). In the first study, routine mixing procedures were simulated to determine if inclusion of RPL products in TMR altered in situ release of Lys. Following mixing, Dacron bags containing RPL products were ruminally incubated for 0, 6, 12, or 24h to determine Lys release. The second study occurred independently of the first, in which Lys release from RPL products was evaluated when incorporated into a TMR that differed in dry matter (DM) content. Bags containing TMR and RPL product mixture were stored at room temperature for 0, 6, 18, and 24h to simulate RPL product exposure to TMR when mixed and delivered once per day. Concentration of free Lys in both studies was determined using ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Following mechanical mixing, ruminal Lys release was significantly greater for C and tended to increase for F. Mechanical mixing did not alter ruminal Lys release from other RPL products evaluated. Hours of ruminal incubation significantly altered Lys release for all products evaluated, and a significant interaction of mechanical mixing and hours of ruminal incubation was observed for A and C. Exposure to lower TMR DM (40.5 versus 51.8%) significantly increased Lys release from B but did not alter Lys release from the other RPL products evaluated. Moreover, time of exposure to TMR significantly increased Lys release from all RPL products evaluated, and a significant interaction of TMR DM and time of exposure to TMR was observed for B and E. These data suggest mechanical mixing and variation in TMR DM may compromise the rumen protection of RPL products; therefore, on-farm feeding practices may alter efficacy of RPL products in dairy rations.","author":[{"family":"Ji","given":"P."},{"family":"Tucker","given":"H.A."},{"family":"Clark","given":"R.E."},{"family":"Miura","given":"M."},{"family":"Ballard","given":"C.S."}],"citation-key":"Ji2015","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2014-9197","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"1242-1246","title":"Short communication: Effect of on-farm feeding practices on rumen protected lysine products","type":"article-journal","volume":"99"},
  {"id":"Jia2019","abstract":"Objective: Information regarding the vitamin content of silage is limited. This study investigated the changes in the vitamin content of alfalfa and Chinese leymus silages with or without a lactic acid bacterial inoculant. Methods: Alfalfa at the early flowering stage and Chinese leymus at the fullbloom stage were harvested. The treatments for each forage type were control (deionized water only) and 1×106 colonyforming units Lactobacillus plantarum (LP)/g fresh matter. After 45 days of ensiling, all silages were sampled for evaluating the vitamin content, fermentation quality and chemical composition. Results: The LP inoculant decreased the pH value and ammonia nitrogen content of the alfalfa and Chinese leymus silages and significantly (p<0.05) increased the lactic acid, acetic acid concentrations and Flieg’s points. Prior to ensiling, the levels of five Bgroup vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, and pyridoxine) and αtocopherol in alfalfa were significantly (p<0.01) higher than those in Chinese leymus. Ensiling decreased the levels of the five Bgroup vitamins in both alfalfa and Chinese leymus while increasing the αtocopherol content of Chinese leymus. The thiamin, riboflavin, niacin and pantothenic acid levels in the LPtreated silage were significantly (p<0.05) lower than those in the untreated silage for the alfalfa and Chinese leymus. The αtocopherol content in the LPtreated alfalfa silage was significantly (p<0.05) higher than that in the untreated alfalfa silage. There was no significant (p>0.05) difference in pyridoxine content between the untreated and LPtreated silages for both forages. Conclusion: With or without LP inoculation, the levels of the five Bgroup vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, and pyridoxine) in alfalfa and Chinese leymus decreased after 45 days of ensiling, while the αtocopherol content of Chinese leymus increased. The LP inoculant improved the fermentation quality of both the alfalfa and Chinese leymus silages but increased the thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and pantothenic acid loss in the two forages after fermentation.","author":[{"family":"Jia","given":"Tingting"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Zhiqiang"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Run"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Zhu"}],"citation-key":"Jia2019","container-title":"Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences","DOI":"10.5713/ajas.19.0135","ISSN":"19765517","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"1873-1881","title":"Lactic acid bacterial inoculant effects on the vitamin content of alfalfa and Chinese leymus silage","type":"article-journal","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"Johnston2014","abstract":"Chronic copper toxicity was diagnosed in a Jersey herd in the Waikato region of New Zealand following an investigation into the deaths of six cattle from a herd of 250 dry cows. Clinical signs and post-mortem examination results were consistent with a hepatopathy, and high concentrations of copper in liver and blood samples of clinically affected animals confirmed copper toxicity. Liver copper concentrations and serum gamma-glutamyl transferase activities were both raised in a group of healthy animals sampled at random from the affected herd, indicating an ongoing risk to the remaining cattle; these animals all had serum copper concentrations within normal limits. Serum samples and liver biopsies were also collected and assayed for copper from animals within two other dairy herds on the same farm; combined results from all three herds showed poor correlation between serum and liver copper concentrations. To reduce liver copper concentrations the affected herd was drenched with 0.5 g ammonium molybdate and 1 g sodium sulphate per cow for five days, and the herd was given no supplementary feed or mineral supplements. Liver biopsies were repeated 44 days after the initial biopsies (approximately 1 month after the end of the drenching program); these showed a significant 37.3% decrease in liver copper concentrations (P <0.02). Also there were no further deaths after the start of the drenching program. Since there was no control group it is impossible to quantify the effect of the drenching program in this case, and dietary changes were also made that would have depleted liver copper stores. Historical analysis of the diet was difficult due to poor record keeping, but multiple sources of copper contributed to a long term copper over supplementation of the herd; the biggest source of copper was a mineral supplement. The farmer perceived this herd to have problems with copper deficiency prior to the diagnosis of copper toxicity, so this case demonstrates the importance of monitoring herd copper status regularly. Also the poor correlation between liver and serum copper concentrations in the three herds sampled demonstrates the importance of using liver copper concentration to assess herd copper status.","author":[{"family":"Johnston","given":"Howard"},{"family":"Beasley","given":"Laura"},{"family":"MacPherson","given":"Neil"}],"citation-key":"Johnston2014","container-title":"Irish Veterinary Journal","DOI":"10.1186/2046-0481-67-20","ISSN":"2046-0481","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"20","PMID":"25279139","title":"Copper toxicity in a New Zealand dairy herd","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://irishvetjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2046-0481-67-20","volume":"67"},
  {"id":"johnston2014","abstract":"In animals carotenoids show biological activity unrelated to vitamin A that has been considered to arise directly from the behavior of the parent compound, particularly as an antioxidant. However, the very property that confers antioxidant activity on some carotenoids in plants also confers susceptibility to oxidative transformation. As an alternative, it has been suggested that carotenoid oxidative breakdown or metabolic products could be the actual agents of activity in animals. However, an important and neglected aspect of the behavior of the highly unsaturated carotenoids is their potential to undergo addition of oxygen to form copolymers. Recently we reported that spontaneous oxidation of ß-carotene transforms it into a product dominated by ß-carotene-oxygen copolymers. We now report that the polymeric product is biologically active. Results suggest an overall ability to prime innate immune function to more rapidly respond to subsequent microbial challenges. An underlying structural resemblance to sporopollenin, found in the outer shell of spores and pollen, may allow the polymer to modulate innate immune responses through interactions with the pattern recognition receptor system. Oxygen copolymer formation appears common to all carotenoids, is anticipated to be widespread, and the products may contribute to the health benefits of carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnston","given":"James B."},{"family":"Nickerson","given":"James G."},{"family":"Daroszewski","given":"Janusz"},{"family":"Mogg","given":"Trevor J."},{"family":"Burton","given":"Graham W."}],"citation-key":"johnston2014","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0111346","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",10,31]]},"language":"en","page":"e111346","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Biologically Active Polymers from Spontaneous Carotenoid Oxidation: A New Frontier in Carotenoid Activity","title-short":"Biologically Active Polymers from Spontaneous Carotenoid Oxidation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111346","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"Jolazadeh2019","abstract":"The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dietary supplementation with calcium salts of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids (FA) during the last 3 weeks of gestation on colostrum composition and productive and reproductive performance of nulliparous and parous Holstein cows during the entire subsequent lactation. During the last 3 weeks of pregnancy, cattle (n = 120), within parity, were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments, no fat supplement (CON), a Ca-salt supplement enriched in C18:2n-6 (CSO), or a Ca-salt supplement enriched in eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid FA (CFO). After calving, all cows received a common lactation diet. As expected, cows fed CSO or CFO produced colostrum with higher (P < 0.01) contents of n-6 or n-3 FA, respectively. Colostrum yield and composition were not affected by treatments, but cows fed fat produced colostrum with higher (P < 0.01) IgG concentration. The major impact of treatments on productive and reproductive performance was observed for the contrast comparison of supplemental fat (CSO and CFO) compared with CON. Body weight was not affected by treatments, but at 14 weeks after parturition, cows fed fat tended (P = 0.07) to have a greater body condition score compared with CON cows. Milk yield and 4% fat corrected milk were higher (P < 0.001) for cows fed fat compared with CON (37.8, 34.9 versus 35.2, 33.0 kg/d, respectively) during the experimental period. Milk fat content was higher (P < 0.001) in CON cows compared with cows fed fat (36.1 vs. 34.9 g/kg, P < 0.001). Plasma cholesterol concentrations were higher (P ≤ 0.02) for both fat supplement groups during the pre- and postpartum period, but plasma concentration of non-esterified FA was lower (P < 0.01) for fat-supplemented compared with CON-supplemented cows during postpartum. Fat-supplemented cows had shorter days to first estrus and first insemination (P < 0.04). Total reproductive disorders tended (P = 0.06) to be lower in cows fed supplemental fat than in those fed CON. Cows fed supplemental fat had lower (P = 0.01) incidences of total health disorders compared with those fed CON diet. In summary, prepartum fat supplementation increased milk yield during the entire lactation and improved reproductive performance. Our findings suggest that the benefits of supplemental polyunsaturated FA during the prepartum period only is independent of the n-type of FA.","author":[{"family":"Jolazadeh","given":"A.

  {"id":"jovaisiene2017","abstract":"The aim of the current study was to investigate biogenic amines and mycotoxins concentrations in baled silage (mainly Poaceae family grasses) prepared in organic and conventional farms and to relate these parameters to fermentative parameters. The mean dry matter (DM) content was 364.10±93.31 and 424.70±95.93g/kg in the silage from organic and conventional farms respectively. The silage samples from organic farms had 17.00% higher (P≤ 0.05) tyramine (TY) than the silage from conventional farms. Conventional farm samples were characterized by 46.00% higher histamine (HIS) (P≤ 0.05), 9.80% higher putrescine (PUT) (P≤ 0.05), 17.30% higher cadaverine (CAD) (P≤ 0.05). Aflatoxins (AFL) (total) and zearalenone (ZEN), T-2/HT-2 concentrations were higher respectively 16.00% (P≤ 0.05) and 13.40% (P≤ 0.05), 1.80% (P≤ 0.05) in the silage prepared in organic farms. Deoxynivalenol (DON) concentration was higher 42.40% (P≤ 0.05) in silage from conventional farms. Volatile fatty acids (VFA), lactic acid, ethanol, pH and ammonia nitrogen showed that the silage samples from organic and conventional farms were of good quality. Our study suggests differences in biogenic amine formation or mycotoxins content in silage from organic and conventional farming, but, overall, the measured values are too low to be relevant for animal health. Furthermore, these differences might as well be due to the difference in dry matter content and plant maturity between the organic and conventional silage samples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Jovaišienė","given":"J."},{"family":"Bakutis","given":"B."},{"family":"Baliukonienė","given":"V."},{"family":"Matusevičius","given":"P."},{"family":"Lipiński","given":"K."},{"family":"Antoszkiewicz","given":"Z."},{"family":"Fijałkowska","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"jovaisiene2017","container-title":"Arquivo Brasileiro de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia","container-title-short":"Arq.

  {"id":"Juniper2019","abstract":"This study aimed to determine the effects of supplementing pregnant heifers with the organic selenium (Se) source 2-hydroxy-4-methylselenobutanoic acid (HMSeBA) during the last 8 wk of pregnancy on dam and calf Se status. A total of 42 in-calf heifers were recruited to the study and randomly allocated to 1 of 3 treatments; a negative control (Con), sodium selenite (NaSe), or HMSeBA. Animals were blocked by body weight, body condition score, and expected calving date before treatment allocation. Following enrollment, all animals underwent a 7-wk wash-out period, after which they received their respective supplements, top-dressed daily onto a basal diet for the last 8 wk of pregnancy. Heifer blood samples were taken at weekly intervals from enrollment until 2 wk before expected calving date and as soon as possible after calving for determination of whole-blood glutathione peroxidase activity (GSH-Px) and plasma Se and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations. Selenized AA were determined in plasma samples taken at 3 wk precalving. A colostrum sample was taken as close to parturition as possible for determination of colostrum total Se, selenized AA, and IgG concentration. Calves were blood sampled as close to birth as possible for determination of whole-blood GSH-Px activity and plasma Se and MDA concentrations. Differences in whole-blood GSH-Px activity did not become apparent until calving; GSH-Px activity was lowest in Con heifers but similar between NaSe and HMSeBA heifers. Plasma Se was lowest in unsupplemented heifers and greatest in those supplemented with HMSeBA; this was attributable to greater selenomethionine concentrations in the plasma of HMSeBA heifers. Colostrum Se was lowest in Con heifers and greatest in HMSeBA heifers. The greater Se concentration of HMSeBA heifers was attributable to a greater proportion of total Se comprising selenocysteine; the reason for this is not known. There was no effect of supplementation on colostrum IgG concentration. Plasma Se was lowest in calves born to Con heifers and greatest in those born to HMSeBA heifers. There were no effects of treatment on calf whole-blood GSH-Px activity or plasma MDA concentration. The enhanced Se status associated with HMSeBA supplementation is likely a consequence of selenomethionine supply and may confer benefits to both the dam and her calf postpartum.","author":[{"family":"Juniper","given":"D.

The experiment started on Day 210 of gestation and lasted until the end of the ﬁrst lactation period. Blood samples were collected from each animal at the start of the experiment, 30 days later on the day of calving and then on a monthly basis and were analysed for serum glucose and ketone bodies. On the same days, all animals were monitored for body condition score. Cows were observed for heat every day and were inseminated at ﬁrst heat after the 60th day postpartum. Calving to ﬁrst heat interval, calving to ﬁrst service interval, number of services per conception and calving interval were calculated for both groups. Milk yield for each cow was recorded monthly and 305-day milk yield was calculated. Clinoptilolite supplementation signiﬁcantly increased body condition score and blood serum concentration of glucose and signiﬁcantly decreased blood serum concentration of ketone bodies. Clinoptilolite also improved signiﬁcantly the reproductive parameters evaluated and signiﬁcantly increased milk production. These results indicate that daily dietary administration of 200 g of clinoptilolite can be used for the improvement of animal performance in dairy herds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Karatzia","given":"Maria A."},{"family":"Katsoulos","given":"Panagiotis D."},{"family":"Karatzias","given":"Harilaos"}],"citation-key":"karatzia2013","container-title":"Animal Production Science","container-title-short":"Anim.

  {"id":"Karimi2015","abstract":"The objective of this study was to evaluate cooling to lessen the effects of heat stress during the last 3 wk of gestation on performance and behavior of multiparous Holstein cows. Twenty nonlactating cows were randomly assigned to treatments approximately 21 d before their expected calving date based on mature equivalent milk production and parity. Treatments were only imposed during the last 3 wk of gestation and included heat stress (HT; n = 10) and cooling (CL; n = 10), both under a similar photoperiod (14 h of light and 10 h of dark). Dry cows were housed in a sand-bedded stall with the stall areas for CL cows equipped with sprinklers and fans that were on from 0700 to 1900 h, whereas those for the HT cows were not. After parturition, all cows were housed in a barn with cooling devices. Rectal temperatures were measured daily at 1400 h and respiration rates were recorded by counting the flank movements for 1 min at 1500 h on odd days over the last 3 wk of gestation to calving. Daily dry matter intake was measured from -21 d relative to expected calving to 21 d after calving and milk production was recorded daily up to 180 d in milk. Behavioral changes of dry cows were studied continuously for 24 h at -10 d relative to expected calving. The average temperature-humidity index during the last 3 wk of gestation was 69.7 and was not significantly different between treatments. Heat-stressed cows exhibited greater rectal temperatures (39.5 vs. 39.2°C), greater respiration rates (70.4 vs. 63.3 breaths/min), and decreased dry matter intake (13.7 vs. 15.5 kg/d) compared with CL cows. Compared with HT cows, CL cows produced more milk during 180 d in milk (40.5 vs. 44.6. kg/d). Heat stress decreased ruminating (243.2 vs. 282.5 min/d) and chewing times (390.6 vs. 448.7 min/d) at -10 d before calving. The CL cows had shorter standing times than their HT counterparts (390.4 vs. 474.0 min/d). These results confirm that heat stress abatement in the late gestation period improves performance of dairy cows in subsequent lactation.","author":[{"family":"Karimi","given":"M.

  {"id":"Karlsson2020","abstract":"Dairy cows can produce highly nutritive food products (milk, meat etc.) from fibrous feed e.g. grass and different byproducts from the food and fuel industry, that cannot be consumed directly by humans. However, as there are limited amounts of byproducts available, decreasing the amount of byproduct-based concentrate in the diet could be a strategy for improving sustainability within dairy production if high milk production should be maintained. In this study, 26 multiparous (n = 14) and primiparous (n = 12) dairy cows of the breeds Swedish Red (n = 14) and Swedish Holstein (n = 12) were followed between lactation weeks 1 and 6. They were fed either a low-concentrate (n = 13; LC) or high-concentrate (n = 13; HC) byproduct-based (sugar beet pulp, rapeseed meal, distiller's grain, wheat bran) ration, in combination with highly digestible grass-clover silage ad libitum. To achieve similar concentrate intake per kg body weight in primiparous and multiparous cows, multiparous cows were offered 5 kg concentrate on the LC diet and 15 kg concentrate on the HC diet, while primiparous cows were offered 4 kg concentrate on the LC diet and 14 kg concentrate on the HC diet as target concentrate rations. We found no overall differences in dry matter intake, energy-corrected milk yield, energy balance, blood plasma metabolites, blood hormones or milk fatty acids between cows on the LC and HC diets. However, HC cows had a higher yield of ECM in lactation week 6 and gained body weight compared with LC cows. As expected, multiparous cows had higher dry matter intake and energy-corrected milk yield, but we found no difference in energy balance between parities. However, multiparous cows lost more body condition and had higher blood plasma concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids, indicating that they used more body tissue to support milk production. In conclusion, both multiparous and primiparous Swedish Red and Swedish Holstein dairy cows seem able to adapt to low-concentrate diets in early lactation when the diets are based on byproducts and grass-clover silage, providing the potential to increase sustainability in dairy production.","author":[{"family":"Karlsson","given":"Johanna"},{"family":"Lindberg","given":"Mikaela"},{"family":"Åkerlind","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Holtenius","given":"Kjell"}],"citation-key":"Karlsson2020","container-title":"Livestock Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.livsci.2020.104304","ISSN":"18711413","issue":"June","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"104304","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","title":"Feed intake, milk yield and metabolic status of early-lactation Swedish Holstein and Swedish Red dairy cows of different parities fed grass silage and two levels of byproduct-based concentrate","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2020.104304","volume":"242"},

Thirty-two pregnant Holstein cows were blocked by weight and expected day of calving and randomly assigned to one of 2 treatments during a 6-wk dry period: (1) no additive (CON) or (2) 16.66 g of MOLM/100 kg of body weight (MOLM). Cows were dosed daily from d −35 to 0 relative to calving. All cows received a dry period total mixed ration (TMR). At calving, calves were weighed immediately after birth and blood was sampled before receiving colostrum from their respective dams. Calves received their first colostrum meal within 2.5 h of birth. Calves received their first and second feedings of colostrum from the first-harvest colostrum. Cows' blood was sampled to determine IgG, whereas calves were blood sampled to determine the IgG, glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, and malondialdehyde. Colostrum composition (protein, fat, lactose, total solids, ash, and metabolizable energy) was also determined. The results of the study showed that MOLM did not affect dry matter intake in dams, body weight change, body condition score, colostrum yield, or calf birth weight. The colostrum harvested from MOLM-fed cows was higher in composition (fat, protein lactose, and total solids). Colostrum IgG was greater from cows that received MOLM compared with control from all 6 colostrum harvests. Calves born to MOLM-fed cows were characterized by higher blood glucose whereas lipid peroxidation (nonesterified fatty acids and malondialdehyde) was greatly reduced. Although the level of 16.6 g of MOLM/100 kg of BW did not affect the dam's body weight, calf birth weight and colostrum yield, higher quality colostrum, and higher IgG absorption in newborn calves could be achieved when that MOLM level is supplemented to dairy cows as late as 5 wk prepartum. The increased glucose with reduced lipid peroxidation after receiving maternal MOLM suggests that MOLM can be used as a feed additive not only to improve dams' immunity but to also improve health in early days of life in dairy calf.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kekana","given":"T.

In wk 6 of both periods, the SARA challenge was conducted by replacing 21% of the dry matter of the total mixed ration with pellets containing 50% wheat and 50% barley. Rumen pH was monitored continuously using indwelling pH probes in 4 rumen cannulated cows. Rumen fluid samples were collected 15 min before feed delivery and at 2, 4, 6, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 24 h after feed delivery for 2 d during wk 5 (control) and wk 6 (SARA). Peripheral blood samples were collected using jugular catheters 15 min before feeding and at 6 and 12 h after feeding at the same days of the rumen fluid collections. The SARA challenge significantly reduced average daily pH from 6.17 to 5.97 and increased the duration of rumen pH below pH 5.6 from 118 to 279 min/d.

Eight lactating Holstein cows, 4 of which were ruminally cannulated, were used in a 6-wk experiment and were fed once daily at 0900 h. During wk 1, cows received a diet containing 50% of DM as concentrate and 50% of DM chopped alfalfa hay. Between wk 2 and wk 6, alfalfa hay was gradually replaced with alfalfa pellets at the rate of 8% per week to reduce rumen pH. Rumen pH was monitored continuously in the ruminally cannulated cows using indwelling pH probes. Rumen fluid and peripheral blood were sampled 15 min before feed delivery and at 6 h after feed delivery. Based on adopted threshold of SARA of at least 180 min/d below pH 5.6, SARA was induced from wk 3 onwards. Replacing 40% of alfalfa hay with alfalfa pellets quadratically increased the DMI from 18.1 kg/d in wk 1 to 23.4 kg/d in wk 6. This replacement linearly decreased milk yield (32.7 vs. 35.9 kg/d) and milk fat percentage and yield (2.32 vs. 3.22%, and 0.77 vs. 1.14 kg/d, respectively), but increased milk protein percentage and yield (3.80 vs. 3.04%, and 1.23 vs. 1.07 kg/d, respectively). This gradual replacement also linearly increased the daily averages of total volatile fatty acids (90 to 121.9 mM), acetate (53.9 to 66.8 mM), propionate (21.5 to 39.6 mM), and osmolality (277.7 to 293.8 mmol/kg) in the rumen and decreased the acetate to propionate ratio from 2.62 to 1.73. Replacing alfalfa hay with alfalfa pellets linearly increased blood lactate from 1.00 mM in wk 1 to a peak of 3.46 mM in wk 5.

  {"id":"khan2011","abstract":"A feeding regimen that allows a smooth transition from milk to solid feed is vital for successful heifer-rearing programs. In the past, research efforts have focused on the development of feeding methods that allow early weaning, perhaps because the risk of disease is highest during the milk feeding stage. To encourage early intake of calf starter, conventional feeding programs have limited the supply of milk (often to 10% of BW at birth). However, dairy calves provided free access to milk will typically consume more than twice this amount. We critically review the available literature examining the relationship between milk feeding method, solid feed consumption, and rumen development in young dairy calves and identify areas where new work is required. We conclude that milk-fed dairy calves can safely ingest milk at approximately 20% of body weight (BW)/d, and greater milk consumption supports greater BW gain, improved feed efficiency, reduced incidence of disease, and greater opportunity to express natural behaviors, which in combination suggest improved welfare. Method of weaning greatly influences feed consumption, rumen development, and growth check in calves provided higher amounts of milk. Gradual weaning encourages starter intake during the preweaning period, and both weaning age and duration of weaning influence this consumption. Increased solid feed consumption during the weaning process contributes to rumen development, permitting higher starter intake and BW gain after weaning. Growth factors in milk may also enhance the growth and maturation of the gastrointestinal tract, but more research is required to understand the role of these factors. Greater nutrient supply through increased amount of milk appears to improve immune function and long-term performance of heifer calves; for example, reducing the age at first breeding and increasing first-lactation milk yield, but more research is needed to confirm these effects.","author":[{"family":"Khan","given":"M A"},{"family":"Weary","given":"D M"},{"family":"Keyserlingk","given":"M A G","non-dropping-particle":"von"}],"citation-key":"khan2011","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"DOI: 10.3168/jds.2010-3733","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"page":"1071-1081","title":"Invited review: Effects of milk ration on solid feed intake, weaning, and performance in dairy heifers","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B9887-526TN5N-17/2/eae3a894b7f315d05e3a65dc4c00a48d","volume":"94"},
  {"id":"Khanchi2013","abstract":"A series of 62 thin layer drying experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit and wind speed on drying rate of switchgrass. An environmental chamber was fabricated that can simulate field drying conditions. An empirical drying model based on maturity stage of switchgrass was also developed during the study. It was observed that solar radiation was the most significant factor in improving the drying rate of switchgrass at seed shattering and seed shattered maturity stage. Therefore, drying switchgrass in wide swath to intercept the maximum amount of radiation at these stages of maturity is recommended. Moreover, it was observed that under low radiation intensity conditions, wind speed helps to improve the drying rate of switchgrass. Field operations such as raking or turning of the windrows are recommended to improve air circulation within a swath on cloudy days. Additionally, it was found that the effect of individual weather parameters on the drying rate of switchgrass was dependent on maturity stage. Vapor pressure deficit was strongly correlated with the drying rate during seed development stage whereas, vapor pressure deficit was weakly correlated during seed shattering and seed shattered stage. These findings suggest the importance of using separate drying rate models for each maturity stage of switchgrass. The empirical models developed in this study can predict the drying time of switchgrass based on the forecasted weather conditions so that the appropriate decisions can be made.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","author":[{"family":"Khanchi","given":"A."},{"family":"Jones","given":"C.

  {"id":"kholif2019","abstract":"There is an increasing interest in the production of biodiesel as bio-renewable fuel source, with numerous biofuel byproducts becoming available. The annual productions of biodiesel and crude glycerol were 34.5 and 3.8 billion liters, respectively, in 2016 and that of biodiesel is expected to reach 41 billion liters in 2019. Glycerol is a sugar alcohol without a color or odor, but with a sweet taste and high solubility index in water. Experiments support the use of glycerol at low levels ranging from 5% to 8% of the diet dry matter as a transition cow therapy. Administration of glycerol increases serum glucose and decreases ketone bodies. Glycerol is very rapidly fermented in the rumen to propionate and butyrate, at the expense of acetate, resulting in a decreased milk fat. Because glycerol is highly fermented in the rumen, it requires an adaptation period at the beginning of feeding. Administration of glycerol in the diet of lactating animals was paralleled with a decreased or an unaffected feed intake in most experiments. Improved ruminal environment to enhance nutrient digestibility was observed in many experiments; however, others observed reduced digestion of dietary fiber with feeding glycerol. Enhanced, lowered, or unaffected milk production and composition were observed with the administration of glycerol in lactating animal diets; however, in most cases, glycerol decreased milk fat content. The inconsistencies between results of experiments are due to the level and the purity of glycerol, diets, production stage of the animals, and other factors. Therefore, further research should be conducted to establish the efficacy of different levels, purity and administration periods of glycerol, and production stage of dairy animals fed glycerol-based or supplemented diets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Kholif","given":"Ahmed E."}],"citation-key":"kholif2019","container-title":"Animal Nutrition","container-title-short":"Animal Nutrition","DOI":"10.1016/j.aninu.2019.06.002","ISSN":"2405-6545","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"209-216","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Glycerol use in dairy diets: A systemic review","title-short":"Glycerol use in dairy diets","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240565451830297X","volume":"5"},

Diets were fed for about 4 weeks prepartum. Blood samples were taken periodically, and the collected plasma analyzed for concentrations of calcium, phosphorus, hydroxyproline and 1,25 dihydroxyergocalciferol plus 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-(OH)2D). Cows fed the LCLP and LCHP diets, when compared to cows fed the HCLP diet, had: a) greater concentrations of plasma 1,25-(OH)2D and hydroxyproline prepartum; b) greater plasma calcium concentrations at parturition; and c) less incidence (0 versus 4 cases) of parturient paresis. Thus, low calcium diets, regardless of dietary phosphorus intake, seemed to activate calcium homeostatic mechanisms before parturition by stimulating both bone and gut. Cows fed the HCLP diet had greater plasma calcium concentrations at parturition than did cows fed the HCHP, even though there was no measurable effect on plasma 1,25-(OH)2D and hydroxyproline concentrations during the prepartal period. It seems possible that the beneficial effect of low dietary phosphorus, when dietary calcium is high, may be a result of a prepartal increase in efficiency of absorption of calcium and phosphorus from the gut caused by increased binding of 1,25-(OH)2D to intestinal receptors.","author":[{"family":"Kichura","given":"T S"},{"family":"Horst","given":"R L"},{"family":"Beitz","given":"D C"},{"family":"Littledike","given":"E T"}],"citation-key":"Kichura1982","container-title":"The Journal of nutrition","ISSN":"0022-3166","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1982"]]},"page":"480-487","PMID":"6895912","title":"Relationships between prepartal dietary calcium and phosphorus, vitamin D metabolism, and parturient paresis in dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","volume":"112"},

  {"id":"Kimura1999","abstract":"Neutrophil function is reduced in periparturient dairy cows. Possible factors that reduce neutrophil function include endocrine changes associated with parturition and metabolic stresses associated with lactogenesis. In this study, mastectomized and intact cows were studied to specifically examine the effects of lactogenesis on neutrophil function in periparturient cows. Expression of adhesion molecules on neutrophils (L-selectin, mediating capture and rolling adhesion, and beta 2-integrin, mediating tight adhesion vital to egress) and neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity (an index of bactericidal activity) were assessed in mastectomized and intact cows. Expression of L-selectin decreased at parturition followed by rapid recovery to prepartum values in both intact and mastectomized cows. Expression of beta 2-integrins increased in intact cows at parturition but not in mastectomized cows. Expression of beta 2-integrins was greater in intact cows than in mastectomized cows throughout the study. Neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity decreased from baseline prepartum values as parturition approached in both intact and mastectomized cows, which suggests the endocrine changes associated with the act of parturition are predominant factors causing loss of neutrophil function. Myeloperoxidase activity recovered to prepartum values within a week of parturition in mastectomized cows; however, myeloperoxidase activity remained depressed in neutrophils obtained from intact cows throughout the first 20 d of lactation. The presence of the mammary gland and its attendant metabolic stresses slowed recovery of neutrophil function, which suggests that the metabolic stress of lactation exacerbated periparturient immunosuppression.","author":[{"family":"Kimura","given":"K"},{"family":"Goff","given":"J P"},{"family":"Kehrli","given":"M E"}],"citation-key":"Kimura1999","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(99)75489-5","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"page":"2385-92","PMID":"10575605","title":"Effects of the presence of the mammary gland on expression of neutrophil adhesion molecules and myeloperoxidase activity in periparturient dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030299754895/fulltext","volume":"82"},
  {"id":"Kimura2002","abstract":"It is unclear why some cows fail to expel the placenta following calving. One theory suggests the fetal placenta must be recognized as \"foreign\" tissue and rejected by the immune system after parturition to cause expulsion of the placenta. We hypothesized that impaired neutrophil function causes retained placenta (RP). We examined the ability of neutrophils to recognize fetal cotyledon tissue as assessed by a chemotaxis assay, which utilized a placental homogenate obtained from a spontaneously expelled placenta as the chemoattractant. Neutrophil killing ability was also estimated by determining myeloperoxidase activity in isolated neutrophils. Blood samples were obtained from 142 periparturient dairy cattle in two herds. Twenty cattle developed RP (14.1%). Neutrophils isolated from blood of cows with RP had significantly lower neutrophil function in both assays before calving, and this impaired function lasted for 1 to 2 wk after parturition. The addition of antibody directed against interleukin-8 (IL-8) to the cotyledon preparation used as a chemoattractant inhibited chemotaxis by 41%, suggesting that one of the chemoattractants present in the cotyledon at parturition is IL-8. At calving, plasma IL-8 concentration was lower in RP cows (51 +/- 12 pg/ml) than in cows expelling the placenta normally (134 +/- 11 pg/ml). From these data, we suggest that neutrophil function is a determining factor for the development of RP in dairy cattle. Also, depressed production of IL-8 may be a factor affecting neutrophil function in cows developing RP.","author":[{"family":"Kimura","given":"Kayoko"},{"family":"Goff","given":"Jesse P"},{"family":"Kehrli","given":"Marcus E"},{"family":"Reinhardt","given":"Timothy A"}],"citation-key":"Kimura2002","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(02)74107-6","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"page":"544-50","PMID":"11949858","title":"Decreased neutrophil function as a cause of retained placenta in dairy cattle.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030202741076","volume":"85"},

  {"id":"King2016","abstract":"The objective of this work was to assess the effect of timing of feed delivery on the behavior and productivity of cows milked 3 times per day. Twelve lactating Holstein dairy cows (4 primiparous and 8 multiparous), milked 3 times per day (at 1400, 2100, and 0700 h), were individually assigned and exposed to each of 2 treatments (over 21-d periods) in a replicated crossover design. Treatments were the manipulation of timing of TMR delivery, 2 times per day, in relation to milking time: (1) feeding at milking time (at 1400 and 0700 h), and (2) feeding halfway between milking times (at 1730 and 1030 h). Milk production, feeding, sorting, and rumination behavior were monitored for each animal for the last 7d of each treatment period. Milk samples were collected for 2 of the last 4d of each period for milk component analysis. With a feed delivery delay, dry matter intake (DMI) tended to be lower (26.5 vs. 27.2kg/d). Although no difference was found in feeding time (224.2min/d), cows fed with a delay consumed their feed more slowly (0.12 vs. 0.13kg of dry matter/min) in more frequent meals (10.0 vs. 9.1 meals/d), which were smaller in size (2.8 vs. 3.1kg/meal) and tended to be shorter in duration (26.7 vs. 30.1min/meal). Cows fed at milking sorted for long particles (102.3%), whereas cows fed with a delay did not sort for or against those particles. Cows sorted for medium particles to a similar extent (102.5%) on each treatment. Cows did not sort for or against short particles on either treatment. Sorting against fine particles was observed, to a similar extent (97.1%), on both treatments. Rumination time (8.9 h/d) and lying time (9.5 h/d) were similar between treatments. Cows without fresh feed at the 1400h milking tended to stand for less time following that milking (71.0 vs. 94.0min), whereas cows without fresh feed at the 0700h milking stood for less time following that milking (66.3 vs. 87.8min). No difference in this latency to lie down was seen at the 2100h milking. Milk yield (48.0kg/d), milk fat content (3.64%), and milk protein content (2.86%) were similar between treatments. Given the tendency for a difference in DMI and no change in yield, efficiency of production was improved with a feed delay (1.93 vs. 1.80kg of milk/kg of DMI). These data suggest that moving the timing of feed delivery resulted in cows consuming their feed more slowly in smaller, more frequent meals, contributing to an improvement in efficiency of production.","author":[{"family":"King","given":"M.T.M."},{"family":"Crossley","given":"R.E."},{"family":"DeVries","given":"T.J."}],"citation-key":"King2016","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2015-9790","ISBN":"1525-3198 (Electronic) 0022-0302 (Linking)","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"1471-1482","PMID":"26709162","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Impact of timing of feed delivery on the behavior and productivity of dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030215009133","volume":"99"},

  {"id":"Kleen2003","abstract":"Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) is likely to arise when an easily palatable, high-energy diet meets a ruminal environment not adapted to this type of substrate. Increase of short-chained fatty acids (SCFA) will occur. Eventually, this may result in a transient nadir of ruminal pH below 5.5. Two situations are likely to represent the risk of SARA. First, fresh lactating cows are confronted with a diet considerably differing from that in the dry-period. A diet change carried out too rapidly or without proper transition management will put the animals at risk. Secondly, further in lactation, inaccurate calculation of dry-matter-intake (DMI) leading to wrong roughage/concentrate ratio, an inadequate content of structure within the diet or mistakes in preparing of total mixed rations may produce SARA. The consequences of SARA are diverse and complex. Laminitis is regularly connected to SARA and the negative impact of organic acids on the ruminal wall may lead to parakeratosis enabling translocation of pathogens into the bloodstream provoking inflammation and abscessation throughout the ruminant body. Moreover, milk-fat depression (MFD) can be related to SARA. In order to achieve a proper diagnosis, SARA has to be understood as a herd-management problem. A screening of the herd for SARA by means of a rumenocentesis, performed on a sample-group, preferably 12 individuals, may reveal the presence of SARA. The herd screening should include the risk group suspected, preferably. The prevention of SARA applies to the principles of ruminant feeding. Careful transition management from the dry to the lactation period and control of fibre-content and ration quality should be more yielding than the use of buffers or antibiotic drugs.","author":[{"family":"Kleen","given":"J L"},{"family":"Hooijer","given":"G","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Rehage","given":"J"},{"family":"Noordhuizen","given":"J P T M"}],"citation-key":"Kleen2003","container-title":"Journal of veterinary medicine.

Signiﬁcant time (P < 0.001) and treatment (P < 0.001) eﬀects were observed for PAs.

In all silages, seneciphylline and senecionine N-oxides were undetectable after 3 days, whereas senkirkine, the most abundant PA, remained stable.\nCONCLUSIONS: Silage prepared from grass contaminated with eastern groundsel still contained high PA levels, and was hence a potential health hazard. Molasses supplementation reduced concentrations of senecionine and seneciphylline, while the bacterial inoculants had no eﬀect. Other potentially toxic PA metabolites were not analyzed in the present study and further research is needed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Klevenhusen","given":"Fenja"},{"family":"Pieper","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Winter","given":"Janine"},{"family":"Ronczka","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Speer","given":"Karl"}],"citation-key":"klevenhusen2019","container-title":"Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"klevenhusen2022","abstract":"Pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA) producing plants like Senecio jacobaea or Senecio vernalis are undesirable in fields for forage production, since PA are toxic to animals and humans. Previous studies have shown that ensiling can decrease the PA content in forages; however, no direct comparison of diverse PA from different Senecio spp. under various ensiling conditions has been made. Therefore, it was hypothesised that individual PA might react differently to ensiling, and silage inoculation with Lactobacillus will affect PA degradation because of a quick drop in pH, contrastingly to poor silage qualities resulting from contamination with soil. Laboratory scale grass silages were prepared in a multifactorial design with two levels of dry matter contents, four ensiling treatments and two storage durations (10 and 90 d). For each combination, four replicates were prepared individually. Ensiling treatments were (1) 10 ml water per kg fresh matter as control (CON), (2) 10 ml heterofermentative Lactobacillus buchneri strain LN4637 at 3 · 105 cfu/kg fresh matter plus 25 g molasses/kg fresh matter (LBHE), (3) 10 ml homofermentative lactobacilli at 3 · 105 cfu/kg fresh matter plus 25 g molasses/kg fresh matter (LBHO) and (4) 10 g soil/kg fresh matter (SOIL). Treatments affected formation of fermentation acids. Acetic acid was highest with treatment LBHE, and butyric acid was highest with treatment SOIL. All ensiling treatments effectively reduced total PA content by degrading the PA N-oxide (PANO) fraction. In parallel, though, the fraction of the tertiary base forms increased by around one-tenth of the original PANO content. Contents of jaconine and senkirkine were higher after ensiling than before, with regards to the sum of PA and PANO for jaconine, indicating higher stability or new formation through degradation of other PA. Overall, ensiling offers opportunities to decrease the PA-PANO content in feed and therefore lowers the risk of intoxication by Senecio in livestock.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Klevenhusen","given":"Fenja"},{"family":"These","given":"Anja"},{"family":"Taenzer","given":"Julian"},{"family":"Weiß","given":"Kirsten"},{"family":"Pieper","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"klevenhusen2022","container-title":"Archives of Animal Nutrition","DOI":"10.1080/1745039X.2022.2084321","ISSN":"1745-039X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,4]]},"page":"93-111","PMID":"35766237","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Effects of ensiling conditions on pyrrolizidine alkaloid degradation in silages mixed with two different Senecio spp.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1745039X.2022.2084321","volume":"76"},

Laboratory experiments with whole-plant and ground ear corn ensiled in glass jars showed that the acetic and lactic acid contents of the resultant silages were directly related to the moisture content of the material ensiled. Acid production during ensiling was increased approximately 100% by the addition of 1% calcium carbonate. Addition of 1% dolomitic limestone to whole-plant corn ensiled in conventional silos increased acid production by 40%.

We hypothesized that smaller and more frequent MR meals would increase starter intake and growth when greater amounts of MR nutrients are fed to nursery calves. Forty-eight Holstein and Holstein-cross heifer and bull calves were assigned to treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of MR and FF. Treatments included (1) standard 20% CP and 20% fat MR fed at 1.5% of body weight (BW; 2 meals/d; STD2), (2) standard 20% CP and 20% fat MR fed at 1.5% of BW (4 meals/d; STD4), (3) modified 26% CP and 18% fat MR fed at 2.0% of BW (2 meals/d; MOD2), and (4) modified 26% CP and 18% fat MR fed at 2.0% of BW (4 meals/d; MOD4; n=12). All calves were fed at 0600 and 1700 h and STD4 and MOD4 calves were fed 2 additional meals at 1100 and 1400 h, resulting in the same amount of MR offered for the 2 × and 4 × treatments. Treatments were fed from d 2 to 42 of age and all MR feeding rates were adjusted weekly to maintain MR solids intakes at 1.5 or 2.0% of BW for STD and MOD diets, respectively, and were reconstituted to 15% total solids. Milk replacer FF was reduced by 50% on d 36 and calves were weaned on d 42. Calves were housed in hutches bedded with straw and offered water and a texturized 18% CP starter ad libitum. Calf body weight and body structure were measured weekly and starter intake and fecal scores were measured daily. Through both 42 and 56 d, calves fed MOD had greater CP and fat intake, resulting in increased average daily gain, heart girth, circulating nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), and muscle total lipid compared with calves fed STD diets. Calves fed MOD diets consumed less starter grain than STD calves but total dry matter intake was similar among treatments. Increased FF for STD calves resulted in greater starter intake at weaning but increasing FF of MOD calves did not have this effect. Due to differences in starter intake, total dry matter by calves through d 56 was similar across treatments. Additionally, increased FF tended to increase serum NEFA concentrations. Serum NEFA concentration was negatively correlated with starter intake. The BW of calves fed STD2 and STD4 treatments almost doubled and the BW of calves on the MOD2 and MOD4 treatments doubled by d 56. Increased FF of the conventional MR program but not accelerated MR program increased starter intake. Increased FF did not affect growth, starter intake, or gain:feed ratio.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Kmicikewycz","given":"a D"},{"family":"Silva","given":"D N L","non-dropping-particle":"da"},{"family":"Linn","given":"J G"},{"family":"Litherland","given":"N B"}],"citation-key":"Kmicikewycz2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5738","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",2]]},"page":"1125-34","PMID":"23219113","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effects of milk replacer program fed 2 or 4 times daily on nutrient intake and calf growth.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23219113","volume":"96"},

  {"id":"koch2023","abstract":"Bull-fattening diets in Europe and most developed countries around the world have traditionally been based on corn silage, starch-rich, and high-energy/ high-protein supplemental feeds. The impact of climate change on crop yields feed availability, and price volatility, requires new and adapted feeding strategies, including for fattening bulls. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the growth performance and economic impact of a representative, conventional corn silage-based (CONVL) total mixed ration, and a dry matter (DRY) total mixed ration (TMR) fed to Simmental bulls. For nine months (272 days), 24 bulls (215 ± 10 kg BW) were randomly assigned to one of two TMR feeding groups (n = 12 per group). The DRY-TMR was primarily characterized by the nutrient fibre source, exclusively based on straw and other by-products. The diets were formulated and balanced based on the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System. After 272 days of fattening, bulls were slaughtered. Feed intake, average daily gain (ADG)/dry matter intake (DMI) ratio, and nutrient intake were affected by treatment, time, and their interaction (P < 0.05). The treatment affected neither acid detergent lignin intake nor starch intake. Compared with CONVL bulls, animals fed DRY-TMR consumed more non-fibre carbohydrates and rumen undegradable neutral detergent fibre, showing lesser dry and fresh matter intake and less metabolizable energy and physically effective neutral detergent fibre (peNDF) intake. Despite differences in nutrient intake (P < 0.05), particle size distribution between the two diets and growth performance were not different (P = 0.45). Simmental bulls in both treatment groups reached target weight in a shorter time due to high ADG of 1.87 kg (DRY-TMR) and 1.84 kg (CONVL). Both treatments achieved a positive profit margin (598 ± 28 €/bull). While total income per bull and dressing percentage did not differ between treatments, the substantially higher feed costs (P < 0.01) of the DRY-TMR resulted in a higher (P = 0.04) income over feed cost in favor of the CONVL treatment group. Despite the higher feed cost of DRY compared with CONVL diets, the better ADG/DMI ratio (P < 0.01) of DRY-TMR contributed to lower absolute feed quantity requirements during the fattening period. Due to the positive profit margin and high ADG results, DRY-TMR solutions for fattening bulls based on straw and by-products can be considered a promising alternative feeding strategy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Koch","given":"C."},{"family":"Schönleben","given":"M."},{"family":"Mentschel","given":"J."},{"family":"Göres","given":"N."},{"family":"Fissore","given":"P."},{"family":"Cohrs","given":"I."},{"family":"Sauerwein","given":"H."},{"family":"Ghaffari","given":"M.

The ammonia-treated wheat straw showed a higher dry matter digestibility (determined by a nylon bag technique) and yielded a larger quantity of dioxane-soluble lignin than the untreated straw. IR spectra indicated the presence of guaiacyl- and syringylpropane units in the two lignins. The two soluble lignins showed similar molecular weight distributions.

Most of the p-coumaric acid in both soluble lignins was present in the ester-linked form, whereas ferulic acid was predominantly in the ether-linked form. The lignin from the ammonia-treated straw was much more abundant in ether-linked ferulic acid than that from the untreated straw. The results provided evidence of the solubilization of the ferulic acid ether-rich lignin fraction from wheat straw by ammonia treatment.

The effect of sodium nitrite and sodium nitrite/hexamine mixtures on silage quality was investigated. A white lupin-wheat mixture was treated with sodium nitrite (NaHe0) (900 g t −1 forage), or mixtures of sodium nitrite (900 g t −1 ) and hexamine. The application rate of hexamine was 300 g t −1 (NaHe300) or 600 g t −1 (NaHe600). Additional treatments were the untreated control (Con), and formic acid (FA) applied at a rate of 4 L t −1 (1000 g kg −1 ). RESULTS: Additives improved silage quality noticeably only by reducing silage ammonia content compared with the control. The addition of hexamine to a sodium nitrite solution did not improve silage quality compared with the solution containing sodium nitrite alone. The increasing addition of hexamine resulted in linearly rising pH values (P < 0.001) and decreasing amounts of lactic acid (P < 0.01). Sodium nitrite based additives were more effective than formic acid in preventing butyric acid formation. Additives did not restrict the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae compared to the control.

  {"id":"Kononoff2003","abstract":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of reducing forage particle length (FPL) and the inclusion of cottonseed hulls (CSH) on intake, digestibility, chewing activity, and milk production of cows in early lactation. Sixteen multiparous cows averaging 17 +/- 3 d in milk and 677 +/- 58 kg BW were assigned to one of four 4 x 4 Latin squares. One square contained ruminally cannulated cows to evaluate effects of treatment on rumen fermentation and function. During each of the 23-d periods, cows were offered one of four total mixed rations that differed in particle length (long or short corn silage) and CSH inclusion rate (0 or 8% DM). Dietary treatments were: long no CSH (LGNH), long with CSH (LGH), short no CSH (SHNH), and short with CSH (SHH). Total physically effective NDF content, measured as percentage of NDF greater than 1.18 mm, was similar across diets, but mean particle length decreased with reducing FPL and inclusion of CSH. Dry matter intake was not significantly affected by FPL but was significantly increased with the inclusion of CSH. Decreasing FPL and the inclusion of CSH significantly increased neutral detergent fiber intake. Total chewing activity expressed as minutes per day was unaffected by FPL and the inclusion of CSH. Both eating and ruminating efficiency expressed as minutes per kilogram of neutral detergent fiber intake increased with increasing FPL and decreased with the inclusion of CSH. Milk production did not differ across treatments, but the inclusion of CSH significantly increased percent and yield of milk protein. Reducing FPL tended to reduce percentage milk fat but not yield. Mean ruminal pH was not affected by FPL but was highest on diets containing CSH, even though no treatment effects were observed on total VFA, acetate, or propionate concentration.

  {"id":"Korhonen2002","abstract":"This study conducted according to a 4 x 4 Latin square with 28 d periods and four ruminally cannulated Finnish Ayrshire cows investigated the effect of protein supplements differing in amino acid (AA) profile and rumen undegradable protein content on postruminal AA supply and milk production. Mammary metabolism of plasma AA and other nutrients were also studied. The basal diet (Control; 13.4% crude protein) consisted of grass silage and barley in a ratio of 55:45 on a dry matter basis. The other three isonitrogenous diets (17.0% crude protein) were control + fishmeal (FM), control + soybean meal (SBM), and control + corn gluten meal (CGM). The protein supplements replaced portions of dry matter of the control diet maintaining the silage to barley ratio constant for all diets. Dry matter intake was limited to 95% of the preexperimental ad libitum intake and was similar (mean 19.8 kg/d dry matter) across the diets. Protein supplements increased milk, lactose, and protein yields but did not affect yields of energy-corrected milk or milk fat. Milk protein yield response was numerically lowest for diet SBM. Protein supplements increased milk protein concentration but decreased milk fat and lactose concentrations. Microbial protein synthesis and rumen fermentation parameters were similar across the diets, except for an increased rumen ammonia concentration for diets supplemented with protein feeds. Protein supplements increased N intake, ruminal organic matter and N, and total tract organic matter, N, and neutral detergent fiber digestibilities. Protein supplements also increased N and AA flows into the omasum, with SBM giving the lowest and CGM the highest flows. This was associated with an unchanged microbial N flow and a higher undegraded dietary N flow. The omasal flows of individual AA reflected differences in total N flow and AA profile of the experimental diets. Differences in AA flows did not always reflect plasma AA concentrations. The results indicated that AA supply of dairy cows fed a grass silage-cereal diet can be manipulated using protein supplements differing in ruminal protein degradability and AA profile. Lower milk production response to SBM than that to FM and CGM appeared to be related mainly to lower N and AA supplies arising from a high ruminal protein degradability of SBM. Histidine appeared to be the first limiting AA for milk protein synthesis on the control diet. Mammary gland may regulate AA uptake according to requirements.","author":[{"family":"Korhonen","given":"M"},{"family":"Vanhatalo","given":"a"},{"family":"Huhtanen","given":"P"}],"citation-key":"Korhonen2002","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(02)74422-6","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",12]]},"page":"3336-51","PMID":"12512607","title":"Effect of protein source on amino acid supply, milk production, and metabolism of plasma nutrients in dairy cows fed grass silage.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12512607","volume":"85"},
  {"id":"kowalskiEffectMicroencapsulatedSodium2015","abstract":"Two trials were conducted to determine the effect of sodium butyrate microencapsulated within triglyceride matrix (Na-butyrate) in the close-up period on performance of dairy cows and rumen papillae development. In trial 1, 26 Holstein-Friesian cows were randomly allocated to 2 groups (13 cows/group) and fed prepartum a total mixed ration (TMR) without or with 300g of Na-butyrate/d from 30 d before expecting calving to parturition. After calving, the same lactational TMR without Na-butyrate was offered to both treatments. Dry matter intake and milk yield were monitored daily to 60 d in milk, and body condition of cows was scored on d 30, 21, and 4 before parturition and d 14, 31, and 60 after parturition. On d 15, 10, and 5 before parturition blood samples were collected from 6 cows randomly chosen from each group and analyzed for plasma β-hydroxybutyrate and nonesterified fatty acids concentrations. No differences in dry matter (DM) intake, milk yield, body condition score, or plasma β-hydroxybutyrate and nonesterified fatty acids concentrations was observed between treatments; however, in the last 5 d before parturition the cows receiving Na-butyrate ate 1.7kg of DM/d more, on average, as compared with control cows. In trial 2, 12 Holstein-Friesian growing bulls (404±48; body weight ± SD) were used to determine the effect of Na-butyrate inclusion in the diet on rumen papillae development. Bulls were randomly allocated to 2 groups (6 bulls/group) and fed TMR without or with 2% (on a dry matter basis) of Na-butyrate for 21 d. At the end of the study, bulls were killed and rumen fluid and rumen tissue samples from dorsal and ventral sac of the rumen were collected. No effect of Na-butyrate supplementation on BW of bulls and DMI during the trial period was observed. Sodium butyrate supplementation increased total short-chain fatty acid concentration in the rumen but had no effect on rumen pH, molar proportions of short-chain fatty acids, and NH3-N concentration. In dorsal sac of the rumen, papillae length and papillae cross-section surface area were increased as a result of Na-butyrate supplementation, whereas in the ventral sac a reverse effect was observed (significant treatment × location in the rumen interaction). Both in the dorsal and ventral sac of the rumen, dietary Na-butyrate increased rumen muscle layer thickness. Altogether, results of this study suggest that Na-butyrate supplementation in the close-up diet may have a potential to enhance rumen papillae growth and rumen adaptation to postpartum diet but lactation performance was not affected under conditions of the current study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Kowalski","given":"Z.

  {"id":"Kramer2013","abstract":"Rumen passage kinetics of forage and concentrate fiber were analyzed to determine intrinsic feed effects and extrinsic ration effects on the retention time of fiber in the rumen. Sixteen Danish Holstein cows (557 ± 37 kg of body weight, 120 ± 21 d in milk, mean ± SD), 8 fitted with ruminal cannulas, were used in a completely randomized block experiment. Treatments differed in forage type (corn silage vs. grass silage) and forage:concentrate ratio (50:50 vs. 75:25 on organic matter basis). Fiber passage kinetics were studied based on rumen evacuations and on marker excretion profiles in feces fitted to 1 and 2 pool models. Each cow received ytterbium (Yb)-labeled fiber of the forage fed in the ration, samarium (Sm)-labeled fiber of the forage not fed in the ration, and concentrate fiber labeled with lanthanum (La), all as a single pulse dose. Nineteen fecal grab samples were taken per cow. Rumen liquid passage was studied using chromium-EDTA dosed as a single pulse into the rumen, followed by sampling of rumen liquid from both the ventral and medial rumen. Rumen mean retention time did not differ between forages when based on Yb-excretion profiles but was numerically longer for grass silage- than for corn silage-based rations using rumen evacuation data. Liquid rate of passage did not differ when calculated from medial or ventral rumen liquid samples, indicating that estimates for the probability of rumen liquid escape were independent of rumen sampling site. Total mean retention time decreased from forage fiber to concentrate fiber to liquid. The forage type itself (corn silage or grass silage) rather than the ration composition seemed to determine the total-tract retention time of forage fiber.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Krämer","given":"M"},{"family":"Lund","given":"P"},{"family":"Weisbjerg","given":"M R"}],"citation-key":"Kramer2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-6146","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,13]]},"page":"3163-3176","PMID":"23498017","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Rumen passage kinetics of forage- and concentrate-derived fiber in dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23498017","volume":"96"},
  {"id":"Kristensen2010","abstract":"The present study aimed to investigate the effects of 2 corn silage inoculation strategies (homofermentative vs. heterofermentative inoculation) under field conditions and to monitor responses in silage variables over the feeding season from January to August. Thirty-nine commercial dairy farms participated in the study. Farms were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: control (nonactive carrier; Chr. Hansen A/S, Hørsholm, Denmark), Lactisil (inoculation with 1 x 10(5)Lactobacillus pentosus and 2.5 x 10(4)Pediococcus pentosaceus per gram of fresh matter; Chr. Hansen A/S), and Lalsil Fresh (inoculation with 3 x 10(5)Lactobacillus buchneri NCIMB 40788 per gram of fresh matter; Lallemand Animal Nutrition, Blagnac, France). Inoculation with Lactisil had no effects on fermentation variables and aerobic stability. On the contrary, inoculation with Lalsil Fresh doubled the aerobic stability: 37, 38, and 80+/-8h for control, Lactisil, and Lalsil Fresh, respectively. The effect of Lalsil Fresh on aerobic stability tended to differ between sampling times, indicating a reduced difference between treatments in samples collected in April. Lalsil Fresh inoculation increased silage pH and contents of acetic acid, propionic acid, propanol, propyl acetate, 2-butanol, propylene glycol, ammonia, and free AA. The contents and ratios of DL-lactic acid, L-lactic acid relative to DL-lactic acid, free glucose, and DL-lactic acid relative to acetic acid decreased with Lalsil Fresh inoculation. Lalsil Fresh inoculation increased the silage counts of total lactic acid bacteria and reduced yeast counts. The Fusarium toxins deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, and zearalenone were detected in all silages at all collections, but the contents were not affected by ensiling time or by inoculation treatment. The effect of inoculation treatments on milk production was assessed by collecting test-day results from the involved farms and comparing the actual milk production with predicted milk production within farm based on test-day results from 2007 and 2008. The average milk production of lactating cows at test days during the study (January to September 2009) was 30.7+/-0.5 kg of energy-corrected milk/d. Milk production was 104.6+/-0.7% of the predicted yield and did not differ among treatments. In conclusion, the present study showed that homofermentative inoculants might not compete efficiently or might not deviate sufficiently from the epiphytic flora on whole-crop corn to affect fermentation in standard qualities of corn silage. Heterofermentative inoculation increased aerobic stability and numerous fermentation variables. None of the treatments affected milk production, and more-stable corn silage seemed to have a similar production value as compared with less-stable homofermented silage. Heterofermented silage can be evaluated for its properties to limit aerobic silage deterioration in the feed chain.","author":[{"family":"Kristensen","given":"N.B."},{"family":"Sloth","given":"K.H."},{"family":"Højberg","given":"O."},{"family":"Spliid","given":"N.H."},{"family":"Jensen","given":"C."},{"family":"Thøgersen","given":"R."}],"citation-key":"Kristensen2010","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2010-3136","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"page":"3764-3774","PMID":"20655446","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effects of microbial inoculants on corn silage fermentation, microbial contents, aerobic stability, and milk production under field conditions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2010-3136","volume":"93"},

  {"id":"Krizsan2007","abstract":"This study was designed to separate the effect of fermentation quality on voluntary intake of grass silage from other feed factors affecting intake. Variations in DMI were quantified, and the impact on intake was modeled. The relationships between individual silage components and intake were examined. A partially balanced changeover experiment with 30 Norwegian Red steers (137 +/- 16.4 kg of BW) was carried out to determine the intake of 24 silages and of hay harvested from the same parent crop within 60 h. Five forages were fed at a time in each of five 3-wk periods. Every 3-wk period was preceded by 2 wk of feeding a standard silage. Silage DMI ranged from 1.79 to 2.65, with a mean of 2.38 kg x 100 kg of BW(-1) x d(-1). Hay DMI averaged 2.43 kg x 100 kg of BW(-1) x d(-1). Ranges (mean) for the composition of silages were as follows: DM, 166 to 237 (213) g/kg; water-soluble carbohydrates, 16.3 to 70.9 (33.0) g/kg of DM; acetic acid, 11.5 to 64.7 (28.6) g/kg of DM; propionic acid, 0 to 5.2 (1.0) g/kg of DM; butyric acid, 0 to 25.1 (6.0) g/kg of DM; lactic acid, 2.2 to 102 (49.3) g/kg of DM; and NH3-N (not corrected for additive-derived N), 89.3 to 255 (153) g/kg of total N. Silage DMI was closely (P < 0.05) related to DM, ADL, VFA, lactic acid, total acids, the lactic acid:total acids ratio, ADIN, NH3-N (not corrected), histamine, tryptamine, cadaverine, and the total sum of amines (the explained variation in intake ranged from 14 to 53%). The 2 best models describing silage DMI included concentrations in the silage of propionic acid, butyric acid, and lactic acid, and these models explained 75 and 84% of the variation in DMI. The strong correlation (r = 0.84, P < 0.05) between total NH3-N and butyric acid concentrations in silages indicates that these variables described the same variation pattern. The inclusion of NH3-N in the equations describing the effect of fermentation quality on DMI of low-DM grass silage was less useful than that of butyric acid. This was due to the confounded relationship between the NH3-N concentration in silages and the use of ammonium-containing preservatives and to difficulties in correcting for the added ammonium.","author":[{"family":"Krizsan","given":"S.

  {"id":"Krizsan2010","abstract":"A meta-analysis of studies using the flux/compartmental pool method with indigestible neutral detergent fiber (iNDF) as internal marker was conducted to study the effect of extrinsic characteristics and forage type on particle passage rate (k(p)) in cattle. Further, the k(p) prediction equations in the National Research Council (NRC) and the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS) were evaluated. Data comprised 172 treatment means from 49 studies conducted in Europe and the United States. In total, 145 diets were fed to dairy cows and 27 to growing cattle. A prerequisite for inclusion of an experiment was that dry matter intake, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), proportion of concentrate in the diet, body weight, and diet chemical composition were determined or could be estimated. Mixed model regression analysis including a random study effect was used to generate prediction equations of k(p) and to investigate the relationships between NRC and CNCPS predictions and observed k(p) of iNDF. Prediction equations were evaluated by regressing residual values on the predicted values. The best-fit model when forage type was not included was k(p) (%/h) = 1.19+0.0879 × NDF intake (g/kg of body weight)+0.792 × proportion of concentrate NDF of total NDF+1.21 × diet iNDF:NDF ratio (adjusted residual mean square error = 0.23%/h). The best general equation accounting for an effect of forage type was as follows: k(p) (%/h) = F+1.54+0.0866 × NDF intake (g/kg of body weight) (adjusted residual mean square error = 0.21%/h), where F is the forage adjustment factor of the intercept. The value of F for grass silage, fresh grass, mixes of alfalfa and corn silage, and dry or ensiled alfalfa as sole forage component were 0.00, -0.91, +0.83, and +0.24, respectively. Relationships between predicted and observed k(p) were y = 0.53(± 0.187)+0.41( ± 0.0373) × predicted k(p) and y = 0.58(± 0.162)+0.46(± 0.0377) × predicted k(p) for the NRC and CNCPS models, respectively. Residual analysis of the NRC and CNCPS models resulted in both significant mean biases (observed--predicted) of -2.40 and -1.70% and linear biases of -0.59 and -0.53, respectively. The results from this meta-analysis suggest that ruminal particulate matter k(p) is affected by forage type in the diet. Further, the evaluation of NRC and CNCPS models showed that passage rate equations developed from marker excretion curves markedly deviated from observed k(p) of iNDF derived using the rumen evacuation technique.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Krizsan","given":"S J"},{"family":"Ahvenjärvi","given":"S"},{"family":"Huhtanen","given":"P"}],"citation-key":"Krizsan2010","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2010-3457","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",12]]},"page":"5890-901","PMID":"21094762","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"A meta-analysis of passage rate estimated by rumen evacuation with cattle and evaluation of passage rate prediction models.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21094762","volume":"93"},

  {"id":"Kronqvist2021","abstract":"Dairy cow performance is affected by both the nutritional composition and the physical structure of the diet. The structure of total mixed rations (TMR) largely depends on the ingredient composition and structure of forage, dry matter (DM) content, mixing time and type of mixer used. This study investigated feed intake, eating time, milk production, DM digestibility, ruminal pH, time budget, and sorting and antagonistic behaviours in lactating dairy cows fed grass/clover silage and concentrate, either in a TMR or in a compact total mixed ration (CTMR) with decreased particle size and DM content due to addition of water. Two cross-over experiments (3-week periods), each involving 40 lactating dairy cows of the Swedish Red and Holstein breeds, were run simultaneously. Experiment 1 was designed to measure production parameters, feed digestibility and ruminal pH, while Experiment 2 was designed to measure time budget, feed sorting behaviours and antagonistic behaviours at the feed bunk. Diets were fed ad libitum, with the same ingredient composition and a forage:concentrate ratio of 60:40 (DM basis). Decreased particle size in the CTMR diet was achieved by mixing the grass-clover silage in a feed mixer with a vertical auger with knives, before mixing with concentrate in a feed mixer without knives. Decreased DM content in CTMR was achieved by adding water to the mix. Mean DM content of the diet was 51% DM for TMR and 37% DM for CTMR. The results showed lower daily DM intake (26.7 kg DM) and shorter eating time (242 min) in cows fed CTMR than in cows fed TMR (28.5 kg DM and 278 min). Feed digestibility, ruminal pH, daily milk yield (35.1 kg and 35.8 kg for CTMR and TMR, respectively) and milk composition did not differ between the diets. Cows fed CTMR showed less sorting and fewer antagonistic behaviours at feeding than cows fed TMR. The daily time budget of the cows also differed, with cows fed CTMR spending more time resting (+45 min) than cows fed TMR.","author":[{"family":"Kronqvist","given":"Cecilia"},{"family":"Petters","given":"Frida"},{"family":"Robertsson","given":"Ulrica"},{"family":"Lindberg","given":"Mikaela"}],"citation-key":"Kronqvist2021","container-title":"Livestock Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.livsci.2021.104662","ISSN":"18711413","issue":"July","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"104662","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","title":"Evaluation of production parameters, feed sorting behaviour and social interactions in dairy cows: Comparison of two total mixed rations with different particle size and water content","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2021.104662","volume":"251"},
  {"id":"Krueger2008","abstract":"This study examined how different methods of applying a fibrolytic enzyme or ammonia affect the nutritive value of Bermudagrass hay and the performance of beef cattle. Fifty Angus x Brangus crossbred steers (mean initial BW 244 +/- 26 kg) were individually fed for ad libitum intake of a 5-wk regrowth of a mixture of Florakirk and Tifton 44 Bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers] hay for 84 d with a concentrate supplement (77% soybean hull pellets, 23% cottonseed meal (DM basis) fed at 1% of BW daily. The Bermudagrass was conserved as hay without treatment (control), with NH(3) (30 g/kg of DM), or with a fibrolytic enzyme (16.5 g/t, air-dry basis) that was applied immediately after cutting (Ec), at baling (Eb), or at feeding. Chromic oxide was dosed to steers for 10 consecutive days, and fecal Cr concentrations from the last 5 d were used to estimate apparent total tract digestibility. In situ ruminal DM degradability was measured by incubating ground (4-mm) hay samples in duplicate in each of 2 ruminally cannulated cows having ad libitum access to Bermudagrass hay and 500 g/d of soybean meal. Unlike the enzyme treatment, ammoniation increased (P < 0.001) the CP concentration and reduced (P < 0.001) NDF, hemicellulose, and lignin concentrations of hay. Total DMI was greater (P < 0.05) for steers fed hays treated with Ec or NH(3) than for those fed control hays. All additive treatments increased (P < 0.05) DM digestibility, and NH(3), Ec, and Eb treatments also increased (P < 0.01) NDF digestibility. The initial and final BW, ADG, BCS, G:F, and hip height of the steers were not affected (P > 0.05) by treatment. The wash loss fractions in hays treated with Ec and Eb were lower than that in the control hay, but the potentially degradable fraction, total degradable fraction, and the effective degradability were increased (P < 0.01) by NH(3) treatment. Application at cutting was the most promising method of enzyme treatment, and this treatment was almost as effective as ammonia for enhancing forage quality.","author":[{"family":"Krueger","given":"N.

  {"id":"Krueger2014","abstract":"To observe the effects of supplemental dietary d-α-tocopherol in relation to dietary energy on growth and immune status in dairy calves, 32 newborn Holstein bull calves were assigned to 1 of 4 treatments for 5 wk in a 2×2 factorial, randomized complete block, split-plot design. Calves received moderate growth (MG) or low growth (LG) all-milk dietary treatments, formulated to support daily gains of 0.5 or 0.25kg/d, respectively, per the dietary energy recommendation for milk-fed calves according to the National Research Council's Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle. Calves in both groups were either injected i.m. with Vital E-A+D (injectable solution of vitamins E, A, and D) on d 1 and supplemented with Emcelle Tocopherol (micellized vitamin E) via milk daily (MG-S and LG-S), or were not supplemented (MG-C and LG-C) during the study period. Total weight gain of MG calves was greater than that of LG calves and tended to be greater in MG-S calves than in MG-C calves. Calves receiving vitamin supplementation demonstrated greater concentrations of plasma α-tocopherol, retinol, and 25-(OH)-vitamin D than did control calves, whereas MG calves demonstrated a lower concentration of plasma α-tocopherol than did LG calves. The apparent increased utilization of α-tocopherol by MG calves was accompanied by a rise in serum haptoglobin, a positive acute-phase protein and indicator of inflammation, especially in MG-C calves. Serum amyloid A, also a positive acute-phase protein, was not different among groups, but was elevated from baseline in all groups during wk 1 through 3. Plasma IgG1 concentrations were higher in MG-S and LG-S calves than in their nonsupplemented dietary counterparts, whereas plasma IgG2, IgA, and IgM concentrations were not different among groups. In summary, dietary supplementation of d-α-tocopherol improved plasma α-tocopherol status and tended to increase growth in calves fed for 0.5 kg of average daily gain. Vitamin supplementation ameliorated the rise of serum haptoglobin associated with acute inflammation in MG calves, and may have improved passive transfer of maternal antibody. These results indicate a role for α-tocopherol in prevention of proinflammatory state associated with greater dietary energy and onset of infectious disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Krueger","given":"L","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Beitz","given":"D C"},{"family":"Onda","given":"K"},{"family":"Osman","given":"M"},{"family":"O'Neil","given":"M R"},{"family":"Lei","given":"S"},{"family":"Wattoo","given":"F H"},{"family":"Stuart","given":"R L"},{"family":"Tyler","given":"H D"},{"family":"Nonnecke","given":"B"}],"citation-key":"Krueger2014","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2013-7315","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6]]},"page":"3715-27","PMID":"24704235","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effects of d-α-tocopherol and dietary energy on growth and health of preruminant dairy calves.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704235","volume":"97"},

Treatment with 1174 inoculant had little effect on silage composition and no effect on cow performance. Silage treated with Ecosyl inoculant had greater lactic acid content, but also greater acetic acid and ammonia N contents. Production of 3.5% FCM was greatest from cows fed silage treated with Ecosyl. In Experiment 2, silage was untreated or treated with Ecosyl and fed in a TMR. Inoculation had no effect on silage composition but increased 3.5% FCM production and DMI as length of time on treatment increased.

The non-BMR hybrid was also cut at a greater height leaving 45 to 50 cm of stalk. Cutting high increased the concentrations of dry matter (+4%), crude protein (+5%), net energy for lactation (+3%), and starch (+7%), but decreased the concentrations of acid detergent fiber (-9%), neutral detergent fiber (-8%), and acid detergent lignin (-13%) for 7511FQ. As expected, the BMR corn silage was 30% lower in lignin concentration than 7511FQ. After 30 h of in vitro ruminal fermentation, the digestibility of neutral detergent fiber for normal cut 7511FQ, the same hybrid cut high, and the normal cut BMR hybrid were 51.7, 51.4, and 63.5%, respectively. Twenty-seven multiparous lactating cows were fed a total mixed ration composed of the respective silages (45% of dry matter) with alfalfa haylage (5%), alfalfa hay (5%), and concentrate (45%) (to make the TMR isocaloric and isonitrogenous) in a study with a 3 x 3 Latin square design with 21-d periods. Milk production was greater for cows fed the BMR hybrid (48.8 kg/d) compared with those fed the normal cut 7511FQ (46.8 kg/d) or cut high (47.7 kg/d). Dry matter intake was not affected by treatment. Feed efficiency for cows fed the BMR silage (1.83) was greater than for those fed high-cut 7511FQ (1.75), but was not different from cows fed the normal cut 7511FQ (1.77). Cows fed the BMR silage had milk with greater concentrations of lactose but lower milk urea nitrogen than cows on other treatments.

  {"id":"Kuoppala2009","abstract":"This study examined the effects of red clover or grass silages cut at 2 stages of growth on feed intake, cell wall digestion, and ruminal passage kinetics in lactating dairy cows. Five dairy cows equipped with rumen cannulas were used in a study designed as a 5×5 Latin square with 21-d periods. Diets consisted of early-cut and late-cut grass and red clover silages and a mixture of late-cut grass and early-cut red clover silages offered ad libitum. All diets were supplemented with 9 kg/d of concentrate. Ruminal digestion and passage kinetics were assessed by the rumen evacuation technique. Apparent total-tract digestibility was determined by total fecal collection. The silage dry matter intake was highest when the mixed forage diet was fed and lowest with the early-cut red clover diet. Delaying the harvest tended to decrease DMI of grass and increase that of red clover. The intake of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and potentially digestible NDF (pdNDF) was lower but the intake of indigestible NDF (iNDF) was higher for red clover diets than for grass diets. The rumen pool size of iNDF and the ratio of iNDF to pdNDF in the rumen contents were larger, and pool sizes of NDF and pdNDF were smaller for red clover than for grass silage diets. Outflow of iNDF and the ratio of iNDF to pdNDF in digesta entering the omasal canal were larger, and the outflow of pdNDF was smaller for red clover than for grass silage diets. The digestion rate (kd) of pdNDF was faster for red clover diets than for grass silage diets. Delaying the harvest decreased kd for grass but increased it for red clover silage diets. Observed differences in fiber characteristics of red clover and grass silages were reflected in ruminal digestion and passage kinetics of these forages. The low intake of early-cut red clover silage could not be explained by silage digestibility, fermentation quality, or rumen fill, but was most likely related to nutritionally suboptimal composition because inclusion of moderate quality grass silage improved silage intake. Increasing the maturity of ensiled red clover does not seem to affect silage dry matter intake as consistently as that of grasses.","author":[{"family":"Kuoppala","given":"K."},{"family":"Ahvenjärvi","given":"S."},{"family":"Rinne","given":"M."},{"family":"Vanhatalo","given":"A."}],"citation-key":"Kuoppala2009","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2009-2250","ISBN":"1525-3198 (Electronic)\\r0022-0302 (Linking)","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"page":"5634-5644","PMID":"19841222","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effects of feeding grass or red clover silage cut at two maturity stages in dairy cows. 2.

Holstein bull calves were raised on an intensified nursing program using milk replacer containing 26% CP and 18% fat. Calves were fed a texturized calf starter containing either dry ground corn at 18.8% of dry matter (DM; CRN), beet pulp replacing dry ground corn at 10.2% dietary DM (BP), or triticale dried distillers grains with solubles replacing dry ground corn and high-protein feedstuffs at 18.6% of dietary DM (DDGS) in the pellet; treatment calf starters differed only in the pellet portion. Starch concentrations of CRN, BP, and DDGS were 35.3, 33.4, and 31.4%, respectively. After a calf consumed 2.50 kg of starter for 3 consecutive days, a small ruminant rumen pH data logger was inserted orally and rumen pH was measured continuously for 4d. Calves were then killed and rumen fluid was sampled to determine volatile fatty acid profile. No difference was found in overall average daily gain or growth rates of hip height, withers height, and heart girth. During the weaning transition, rate of increase in calf starter intake was greater for calves fed DDGS compared with those fed CRN (87.7 vs. 77.5 g/d), but lower for calves fed BP compared with CRN (68.1 vs. 77.5 g/d). The area under pH 5.8 (470 vs. 295 min × pH/d) or pH 5.2 (72.7 vs. 16.4 min × pH/d) was greater for calves fed DDGS than those fed CRN.

Volatile fatty acid profile was not affected by treatment with the exception of molar proportion of butyrate, which tended to be lower for calves fed BP compared with those fed CRN (15.0 vs. 16.6%). Hay intake was positively correlated to mean rumen pH for calves used in this study (r=0.48).

  {"id":"Lacasse2014","abstract":"Holstein multiparous cows (n=29) and primiparous heifers (n=32) calving over a 1-yr period were subjected to photoperiod-melatonin treatments according to a 2×3 factorial design. Starting 8wk before expected calving, all animals were subjected to 1 of the following treatments: 8h of light and 16h of dark (8L:16D), 16h of light and 8h of dark (16L:8D), or 16L:8D plus melatonin feeding (16L:8D-melatonin). Each day at 1355h, the animals in the melatonin treatment received orally a gelatin capsule containing 25mg of melatonin. The treatments ended at calving, when the animals were moved to the lactation barn; all animals were then subjected to about 16h of light per day. At the beginning and end of the treatment period before calving, blood samples were taken from 6heifers and 6cows through a jugular cannula for 24h at 30-min intervals to monitor serum melatonin and prolactin concentrations. Milk production in the heifers was not affected by the photoperiod treatments. Early-lactation milk production was higher in the cows exposed to the short-day photoperiod than in those exposed to a long-day photoperiod (16L:8D and 16L:8D-melatonin), with averages of 36.7±0.9, 33.1±0.8, and 34.1±0.9kg/d for 8L:16D, 16L:8D, and 16L:8D-melatonin, respectively. Photoperiod had no effect on late-lactation milk production in the cows. During lactation, the dry matter intake of heifers was not affected by the treatments, but dry matter intake of the cows exposed to a short-day photoperiod was greater than that of the cows exposed to a long-day photoperiod. Feed efficiency of heifers was improved by short-day photoperiod. During the treatment period, prolactin concentration was lower in the animals exposed to a short-day photoperiod than in those exposed to a long-day photoperiod, was lower with the 16L:8D-melatonin treatment than with the 16L:8D treatment, and tended to be lower with the 8L:16D treatment than with the 16L:8D-melatonin treatment, with averages of 3.5±0.8, 9.9±0.8, and 6.0±0.8ng/mL for 8L:16D, 16L:8D, and 16L:8D-melatonin, respectively. In early lactation, prolactin concentration was lower in the heifers exposed to the 16L:8D photoperiod during the dry period than in those exposed to the 8L:16D photoperiod or fed melatonin. In conclusion, a short-day photoperiod during the dry period transiently increases milk production of cows and the feed efficiency of heifers in the following lactation. However, melatonin cannot be used to mimic a short-day photoperiod during the dry period.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Lacasse","given":"P"},{"family":"Vinet","given":"C M"},{"family":"Petitclerc","given":"D"}],"citation-key":"Lacasse2014","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2013-7615","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6]]},"page":"3589-98","PMID":"24704221","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of prepartum photoperiod and melatonin feeding on milk production and prolactin concentration in dairy heifers and cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704221","volume":"97"},

A minimum of 12 preweaned calves were randomly selected and scored for the presence of respiratory disease in each barn. An air sampling device was used to determine airborne bacteria colony-forming units per cubic meter (cfu/m3) of air in calf pens and central alleys within the barns. Airborne bacteria samples were collected on sheep blood agar (BAP) and eosin methylene blue (EMB) agar plates. Temperature and relative humidity were recorded in each calf pen, the barn alley, and outside the barn. Samples of bedding were collected in each pen and DM was measured. Pen bedding type and a calf nesting score (degree to which the calves could nestle into the bedding) was assigned to each barn. Calf numbers, barn and pen dimensions, ridge, eave, and curtain openings, and exterior wind speed and direction were determined and used to estimate building ventilation rates. Factors that were significantly associated with a reduced prevalence of respiratory disease were reduced pen bacterial counts (log10 cfu/m3) on BAP, presence of a solid barrier between each calf pen, and increased ability to nest. Individual calf pen bacterial counts were significantly different from barn alley bacterial counts on both BAP and EMB. Significant factors associated with reduced calf pen bacterial counts on BAP were increasing pen area, increasing number of open planes of the calf pen, decreasing pen temperature, and wood-particle bedding. Significant factors associated with reduced alley bacterial counts on BAP were increased ventilation changes per hour, increased barn volume per kilogram of calf, reduced pen bacterial counts, and barn type.","author":[{"family":"Lago","given":"A."},{"family":"McGuirk","given":"S.M."},{"family":"Bennett","given":"T.B."},{"family":"Cook","given":"N.B."},{"family":"Nordlund","given":"K.V."}],"citation-key":"Lago2006","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72445-6","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"page":"4014-4025","PMID":"16960078","title":"Calf Respiratory Disease and Pen Microenvironments in Naturally Ventilated Calf Barns in Winter","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030206724456","volume":"89"},

Characteristically, weak-acid preservatives do not kill micro-organisms but inhibit growth, causing very extended lag phases. Preservatives are more effective at low pH values where solutions contain increased concentrations of undissociated acids. Inhibition by weak-acids involves rapid diffusion of undissociated molecules through the plasma membrane; dissociation of these molecules within cells liberates protons, thus acidifying the cytoplasm and preventing growth. By modelling preservative action in yeast, using a thermodynamic and kinetic approach, it was possible to demonstrate that: (i) inhibition depends more on the degree to which individual preservatives are concentrated within cells, rather than on undissociated acid concentration per se; (ii) it is entirely feasible for microbes to pump protons out of the cell during extended lag phase and raise internal pH (pHi), despite further influx of preservatives; (iii) the duration of the lag phase can be predicted from the model, using a Gaussian fit of proton-pumping H(+)-ATPase activity against pHi; (iv) theoretical ATP consumption for proton pumping can be directly correlated with the reduction in cell yield observed in glucose-limited cultures.","author":[{"family":"Lambert","given":"R.

Sixty-eight Holstein heifers were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups by using a randomized complete block design in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. The treatments were standard growth rate (700 g/d) or accelerated growth rate (1000 g/d) and estrogen implant or no estrogen implant. The treatments were imposed over 20 wk, beginning at 4.5 mo of age and 130 kg of body weight (BW). During the treatment period, all heifers were fed individually and received the same diet, but the dry matter intake of each heifer was adjusted weekly to achieve the designated growth rate. The estrogen implants were removed at the end of the treatment period at 9.5 mo of age. After the treatment period, the heifers were group fed according to BW and age to allow the heifers to have a similar BW and age at calving. The accelerated growth regimen decreased age at puberty by 32 d. Age, BW, and body condition scores at calving were not significantly different among treatments. The accelerated prepubertal growth regimen decreased first lactation fat-corrected milk yield 7.1%. Prepubertal heifers given estrogen implants produced 5.2% less fat-corrected milk during first lactation than did heifers not implanted with estrogen. Estrogen implants stimulated a large increase in teat length growth during the treatment period, but the advantage was lost posttreatment. Over both the treatment and posttreatment periods, the estrogen implants reduced teat length growth by 30%. Accelerated growth rates from 700 to 1000 g/d and estrogen implants in prepubertal heifers decreased first lactation milk production.","author":[{"family":"Lammers","given":"B.

  {"id":"Lamond1993","abstract":"A series of 240 thin-layer drying runs carried out in 1988 and 1989 at the Scottish Centre of Agricultural Engineering were analysed to find out which factors influenced the rate of drying of grass mixtures. The grass used in the experiments was cut by hand, by a mower without conditioner or by a mower with conditioner. The experiments covered a range of air conditions from 16.0 to 40.4 °C temperature and 24.4 to 82–8 % relative humidity. By fitting curves to the experimental data it was shown that the drying curves could be simulated by a two-parameter, exponential equation. Analysis of the data showed that the experimental results could be adequately represented by holding one of the parameters fixed and fitting the curves with only one parameter varying. The variable parameter, called the drying coefficient, was dependent on harvesting method and related to drying air temperature, initial moisture content and ratio of leaf area to stem area. A regression equation relating the drying coefficient to these variables for conditioned and unconditioned grass is presented. Predictions from the regression equations indicated that the temperature of the drying air had a major effect on the drying coefficient. Both the initial moisture content of the samples and ratio of leaf to stem had a smaller influence on the coefficient over their likely range. © 1993, Cambridge University Press.

It is manifested in a change in locomotion that is associated with lesions, especially the pelvic limbs. The disease of the hoof is painful, affecting the welfare of dairy cows. Important factors that influence the health of the limbs include nutrition, animal hygiene, stable technology, and genetic and breeding predispositions. Nutrition is one of the basic preventive factors affecting the quality and growth of the hoof horn, and the associated prevalence of hoof disease. The strength and structure of the hoof horn are affected by the composition of the feed ration (amino acids, minerals, vitamins, and toxic substances contaminating the feed ration, or arising in the feed ration as metabolites of fungi).","author":[{"family":"Langova","given":"Lucie"},{"family":"Novotna","given":"Ivana"},{"family":"Nemcova","given":"Petra"},{"family":"Machacek","given":"Miroslav"},{"family":"Havlicek","given":"Zdenek"},{"family":"Zemanova","given":"Monika"},{"family":"Chrast","given":"Vladimir"}],"citation-key":"Langova2020","container-title":"Animals","DOI":"10.3390/ani10101824","ISSN":"20762615","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"1-22","title":"Impact of nutrients on the hoof health in cattle","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"Larsen2014","abstract":"The effect of increasing the postpartum metabolizable protein (MP) supply on performance and mammary metabolism was studied using 8 Holstein cows in a complete randomized design. At parturition, cows were assigned to abomasal infusion of water (CTRL) or casein (CAS). Arterial and epigastric venous blood samples were taken 14 d before expected parturition and at 4, 15, and 29 d in milk (DIM). To compensate previously estimated deficiency of essential AA and to avoid oversupply, casein protein infusion was graduated with 696+/-1, 490+/-9, and 212+/-10g/d at 4, 15 and 29 DIM, respectively. Dry matter intake was unaffected by CAS. Compared with CTRL, MP supply was greater at 4 DIM with CAS but did not differ by 29 DIM. Milk yield was greater with CAS (+7.2+/-1.3kg/d from 1 to 29 DIM). Milk protein yield was greater with CAS at 4 DIM and averaged 1,664+/-39g/d compared with 1,212+/-86g/d for CTRL, but did not differ at 29 DIM (1,383+/-48g/d). The ratio of MP total supply to requirement was numerically greater at 4 DIM for CAS compared with CTRL, indicating less postpartum protein deficiency. In contrast, a greater net energy deficiency tended to be induced with CAS, but the greater milk yield allowed a large part of mobilized fat to be secreted in milk. Arterial concentration of total essential AA increased sharply after parturition for CAS compared with slight decreases for CTRL. The patterns of arterial concentrations combined with arterial-mammary venous concentration differences indicated that Lys, Leu, and Tyr were the first-limiting AA at 4 DIM with CTRL. Mammary plasma flow was unaffected by treatment, indicating similar perfusion of mammary tissue. The greater milk yield with CAS was associated with greater mammary uptake of individual essential AA, tendencies to greater uptake of glucose, lactate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate, whereas uptakes of volatile fatty acids were unaffected. Despite similar MP supply by 29 DIM, milk and lactose yields were greater with CAS indicating a persistent response to increased postpartum MP supply. In conclusion, the postpartum MP deficiency can have a substantial negative effect in dairy cows as the major outcome of increasing the postpartum MP supply was increased milk, milk protein, and lactose yield, as well as an enhanced MP balance. Potential positive effects for other body functions than milk synthesis are discussed. Future investigations are needed to delineate how to transfer the effect into practical feeding strategies.","author":[{"family":"Larsen","given":"M."},{"family":"Lapierre","given":"H."},{"family":"Kristensen","given":"N.B."}],"citation-key":"Larsen2014","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2013-7247","ISBN":"1525-3198 (Electronic)\\r0022-0302 (Linking)","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"5608-5622","PMID":"24996271","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Abomasal protein infusion in postpartum transition dairy cows: Effect on performance and mammary metabolism","type":"article-journal","URL":"betera","volume":"97"},

  {"id":"Latham2008","abstract":"Many farm, laboratory, zoo and companion animals experience some form of maternal deprivation. This is typically via separation from their mothers earlier than would happen in free-living populations, in some cases even while young are still dependent upon milk. Maternal deprivation may also occur in a qualitative way, via inadequate maternal care, perhaps caused by inexperience or by restrictive environments that limit maternal behaviours. In this paper we review evidence on the link between early separation from the mother and abnormal behaviour from a wide range of sources, including the early primate studies in this field, more recent examples from zoo and commercially reared animals, and human examples from studies of institutionalised children. We discuss factors that seem to influence the magnitude of later effects, such as developmental stage and age at separation, and whether separation is gradual (i.e. more similar to natural separation) or abrupt (as often the case in captivity). In these instances, however, maternal deprivation is just one aspect of a suite of changes that occur when infants are separated from their mothers. In the second part of the paper we therefore review the few cases where maternal loss per se has been investigated, and studies showing lasting affects of qualitative aspects of maternal care. We then look at the possible mechanisms underlying maternal deprivation-induced stereotypic behaviours including potential frustration of specific motivations, and lasting, more pervasive changes for instance in temperament or motor control. Finally, we discuss the practical and welfare implications of the effects of maternal deprivation, and suggest some topics for future research. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

From d 80 until d 21 precalving, primiparous animals were offered either high or low pasture allowances. Thereafter, these animals were housed and had ad libitum access to a high energy density diet (high E) or restricted access [6 kg of dry matter (DM) per d] to a low energy density diet (low E), respectively, until calving. From d 100 until d 42 precalving, multiparous animals were offered either ad libitum or restricted (10 kg of DM/d) access to a late lactation diet, and thereafter, had ad libitum access to a high E diet or restricted access (7 kg of DM complete diet/d) to a low E diet, respectively, until calving. The forage to concentrate (F:C) ratios (DM basis) of these high E and low E diets [d 42 (d 21 in primiparous animals) until calving] were 64:36 and 83:17, respectively. Cows offered high E and low E precalving diets were allocated to either a high E or low E postcalving diet [F:C ratio (DM basis) of 30:70 and 70:30, respectively] and remained on these diets until d 250 of lactation. Multiparous animals offered a high E diet precalving had a significantly higher body condition score at calving than those offered the low E diet precalving. This effect was not evident in primiparous animals. Precalving diet had no significant effect on plasma nonesterified fatty acid concentrations during the last 3 wk precalving in primi- or multiparous animals. Primiparous animals offered a high E diet precalving had significantly higher postcalving plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acid, suggesting greater mobilization of body reserves. Primi- and multiparous animals offered a high E diet postcalving had a significantly higher dry matter intake, milk yield, and energy status postcalving compared with animals offered a low E diet postcalving. Milk yields of primiparous animals offered high E and low E diets postcalving were 29.7 and 24.8 kg/d, respectively, and milk yield of multiparous animals offered high E and low E diets postcalving were 33.5 and 28.2 kg/d, respectively.

Major clinical signs are induced by the systemic spread of these toxins in the blood and tissues. Enterotoxaemia may be acute or peracute, and sudden death is often reported in rapidly growing, apparently healthy cattle. Enterotoxaemia can be prevented only with better understanding of its risk factors and pathogenesis. This paper provides an up-to-date overview of knowledge concerning the aetiology of the syndrome, its epidemiological context, pathogenesis, clinical signs and lesions, the diagnostic procedures and prophylactic tools, with specific attention to field aspects that are directly relevant to practitioners and clinical researchers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Lebrun","given":"M"},{"family":"Mainil","given":"J G"},{"family":"Linden","given":"a"}],"citation-key":"Lebrun2010","container-title":"The Veterinary record","DOI":"10.1136/vr.b4859","ISSN":"0042-4900","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",7,3]]},"page":"13-22","PMID":"20605954","title":"Cattle enterotoxaemia and Clostridium perfringens: description, diagnosis and prophylaxis.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20605954","volume":"167"},
  {"id":"Leccioli2017","abstract":"Non-coeliac/non-allergic gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCG/WS) is a gluten-related disorder, the pathogenesis of which remains unclear. Recently, the involvement of an increased intestinal permeability has been recognized in the onset of this clinical condition. However, mechanisms through which it takes place are still unclear. In this review, we attempt to uncover these mechanisms by providing, for the first time, an integrated vision of recent scientific literature, resulting in a new hypothesis about the pathogenic mechanisms involved in NCG/WS. According to this, the root cause of NCG/WS is a particular dysbiotic profile characterized by decreased butyrate-producing-Firmicutes and/or Bifidobacteria, leading to low levels of intestinal butyrate. Beyond a critical threshold of the latter, a chain reaction of events and vicious circles occurs, involving other protagonists such as microbial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) and wheat α-amylase trypsin inhibitors (ATIs). NCG/WS is likely to be a multi-factor-onset disorder, probably transient and preventable, related to quality and balance of the diet, and not to the presence of gluten in itself. If future studies confirm our proposal, this would have important implications both for the definition of the disease, as well as for the prevention and therapeutic-nutritional management of individuals with NCG/WS.","author":[{"family":"Leccioli","given":"Valentina"},{"family":"Oliveri","given":"Mara"},{"family":"Romeo","given":"Marcello"},{"family":"Berretta","given":"Massimiliano"},{"family":"Rossi","given":"Paola"}],"citation-key":"Leccioli2017","container-title":"Nutrients","DOI":"10.3390/nu9111203","ISSN":"20726643","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"PMID":"29099090","title":"A new proposal for the pathogenic mechanism of non-coeliac/non-allergic gluten/wheat sensitivity: Piecing together the puzzle of recent scientific evidence","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"Leduc2017","abstract":"Polyphenol oxidase in red clover (RC) silage reduces lipolysis and consequently protects its constituent fatty acids (FA) against biohydrogenation by ruminal microorganisms. Fatty acid biohydrogenation could be further inhibited by reducing the nitrogen (N) supply to ruminal bacteria. To compare the effects of RC and alfalfa (AL) silage fed in diets differing in rumen-degradable protein supply on the transfer efficiency of polyunsaturated FA from diet to milk, and on the resulting FA profile of milk fat, 8 multiparous Holstein dairy cows (72 ± 17 days in milk) were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design (21-day periods including 14 days of adaptation). Four treatments were compared in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement with AL or RC fed in diets formulated to provide 100% (RDP‐100) or 85% (RDP‐85) of calculated rumen-degradable protein requirements. Rumen-degradable protein concentrations were adjusted by varying the supplies of ground vs. steam-flaked corn grains, and untreated vs. heat-treated soybean meals. Feeding RC, as compared with AL diets, decreased ruminal ammonia-N concentration as well as urea-N in plasma and milk. Intakes of c9c12 18:2 and c9c12c15 18:3 were lower for cows fed RC, but their secretion in milk and their apparent transfer efficiency from diet were greater as compared to cows fed AL. As a result, feeding RC increased the concentrations of c9c12 18:2 and c9c12c15 18:3, but decreased the proportions of t11 18:1, c9t11 18:2, and t11c15 18:2 in milk fat. These results are consistent with the lower effective ruminal disappearance of c9c12 18:2 and c9c12c15 18:3 in RC as determined by a 96 h in sacco incubation, and the lower abundance of ruminal bacteria capable of hydrolyzing dietary lipids and hydrogenating polyunsaturated FA (Ruminococcus albus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens) in the rumen content. The apparent transfer efficiency of c9c12 18:2 from diet to milk was further increased by feeding RDP‐85 as compared with RDP‐100 diet. Feeding RC decreased concentrations of linear odd-chain FA (11:0, 13:0, 15:0, 17:0, and c9 17:1) and increased proportions of branched-chain FA (iso13:0, iso14:0, iso15:0, iso16:0, iso17:0, anteiso15:0, and anteiso17:0) in milk fat as compared with AL. In conclusion, as compared with AL, cows fed RC produced milk with greater concentrations of major forage FA (c9c12 18:2 and c9c12c15 18:3) and lower proportions of intermediates in ruminal biohydrogenation of these FA. Variations in milk fat concentrations of odd- and branched-chain FA, which are synthesized in the rumen by various microbial populations, may be reflecting the effects of forage source on ruminal fermentation.","author":[{"family":"Leduc","given":"M."},{"family":"Gervais","given":"R."},{"family":"Tremblay","given":"G.

  {"id":"Leduc2017a","abstract":"Several experiments were conducted over the past few years to evaluate the feeding value of flax seed and oil in dairy cow diets. The current meta-analysis and meta-regression was undertaken to assess the overall effect of different forms of flax, as a source of trienoic (cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 18:3) fatty acids (FA), on lactation performance and on transfer efficiency of its constituent n-3 FA from diet to milk fat. Comparisons were first conducted with nonsupplemented controls or with diets containing either saturated (mainly 16:0 or 18:0 or both), monoenoic (mainly cis-9 18:1), or dienoic (mainly cis-9,cis-12 18:2) FA. Results indicate that supplementing flax seed and oil decreased dry matter intake, as well as actual and energy-corrected milk yield without affecting the efficiency of utilization of dietary dry matter or energy as compared with nonsupplemented iso-energetic controls. When compared with the other 3 types of dietary fat evaluated, flax rich in trienoic FA supported a yield of energy-corrected milk similar to supplements rich in saturated, monoenoic, or dienoic FA. Greater milk fat concentration and feed efficiency were observed with saturated supplements. However, milk fat concentration and yield were lower with dienoic FA than with flax supplements. Further analyses were conducted to compare the effect of different forms of flax oil, seed, or fractions of seed. Among the 6 categories evaluated, mechanically processed whole seed (rolled or ground) allowed the greatest yield of energy-corrected milk and the best feed efficiency when compared with free oil, intact or extruded whole seed, protected flax, and flax hulls. Feeding protected flax and flax hulls allowed the greatest milk fat concentration of cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 18:3. Moreover, the greatest transfer efficiencies of this fatty acid from diet to milk were recorded with the same 2 treatments, plus the mechanically processed whole seed. These results make this last category the most suitable treatment, among the 6 flax forms evaluated, to combine optimum lactation performance and protection of flax constituent cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 18:3.","author":[{"family":"Leduc","given":"M."},{"family":"Létourneau-Montminy","given":"M.

  {"id":"Lee2009","abstract":"This study investigated red clover polyphenol oxidase (PPO), its: activity, activation from latent into active form, and whether grazing at different levels of herbage maturity could result in sufficient PPO activation to protect proteins and glycerol-based lipid in the rumen. Wild-type red clover with high PPO activity and a mutant red clover with low PPO activity were used in five experiments. Firstly to investigate activation of the latent red clover PPO enzyme either through: protease, substrate (ortho-diphenols), cell damage or chemically (sodium dodecylsulphate detergent) induced mediation. Secondly PPO's activity at a range of pHs were determined to show how activation method altered the enzymes activity. Finally whether grazing could activate latent PPO and ultimately result in protected protein and glycerol-based lipid in the rumen was investigated. Incubation of extracted red clover PPO enzyme with a range of ortho-diphenols in the presence of oxygen resulted in rapid conversion of the latent to the active form of PPO. This conversion was blocked by the addition of ascorbic acid suggesting that this mechanism requires formation of ortho-quinones. Cell damage was highly correlated with activation of latent PPO and the formation of protein-bound phenols due to mixing of the chloroplastic enzyme with the vacuolar substrate (ortho-diphenols). The potential for PPO activity to occur during grazing was investigated by measuring the oxygen concentration in red clover boluses and within the rumen and PPO's effect on protein and glycerol-based lipid within red clover boluses. There was a rapid depletion of oxygen from the rumen, limiting the potential for PPO activation and activity to occur to the period of mastication. PPO was shown to be activated in both wild-type and mutant red clover boluses, however, factors such as fibre content and maturity of the red clover herbage (PPO concentration) altered the efficacy of PPO to produce phenol-bound protein. As a result greater protection of glycerol-based lipid in this study was achieved with a prior conditioning (wilting) of the red clover. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  {"id":"Lee2014","abstract":"Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) is predominately associated with the detrimental effect of browning fruit and vegetables, however, interest within PPO containing forage crops (crops to be fed to animals) has grown since the browning reaction was associated with reduced nitrogen (N) losses in silo and the rumen. The reduction in protein breakdown in silo of red clover (high PPO forage) increased the quality of protein, improving N-use efficiency [feed N into product N (e.g., Milk): NUE] when fed to ruminants. A further benefit of red clover silage feeding is a significant reduction in lipolysis (cleaving of glycerol-based lipid) in silo and an increase in the deposition of beneficial C18 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in animal products, which has also been linked to PPO activity. PPOs protection of plant protein and glycerol based-PUFA in silo is related to the deactivation of plant proteases and lipases. This deactivation occurs through PPO catalyzing the conversion of diphenols to quinones which bind with cellular nucleophiles such as protein reforming a protein-bound phenol (PBP). If the protein is an enzyme (e.g., protease or lipase) the complexing denatures the enzyme. However, PPO is inactive in the anaerobic rumen and therefore any subsequent protection of plant protein and glycerol based-PUFA in the rumen must be as a result of events that occurred to the forage pre-ingestion. Reduced activity of plant proteases and lipases would have little effect on NUE and glycerol based-PUFA in the rumen due to the greater concentration of rumen microbial proteases and lipases. The mechanism for PPOs protection of plant protein in the rumen is a consequence of complexing plant protein, rather than protease deactivation per se. These complexed proteins reduce protein digestibility in the rumen and subsequently increase undegraded dietary protein flow to the small intestine. The mechanism for protecting glycerol-based PUFA has yet to be fully elucidated but may be associated with entrapment within PBP reducing access to microbial lipases or differences in rumen digestion kinetics of the forage and therefore not related to PPO activity.","author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Michael R.

The experiment was conducted with 8 ruminally cannulated Holstein cows in a replicated 4×4 Latin square design trial with 21-d periods. Treatments were (1) MP-adequate diet (AMP; MP balance of -24 g/d); (2) MP-deficient diet (DMP; MP balance of -281 g/d); (3) DMP supplemented with 100 g of RPLys/cow per day (estimated digestible Lys supply=24 g/d; DMPL; MP balance of -305g/d); and (4) DMPL supplemented with 24 g of RPMet/cow per day (estimated digestible Met supply=15 g/d; DMPLM; MP balance of -256g/d). Diet had no effect on total-tract nutrient digestibility, milk production, and milk composition, but the DMP diets decreased urinary N excretion and the ammonia emitting potential of manure. Plasma Met concentration was increased by DMPLM compared with AMP. Supplementation with RPLys had no effect on plasma Lys. Concentration of most AA in milk protein was increased or tended to be increased by DMPLM compared with DMPL. Except for the AA supplemented as RPAA (i.e., Met and Lys), apparent total-tract digestibility of all dietary AA was generally greater for the DMP diets and ranged from 33% (Arg, AMP diet) to 67% (Thr, DMPL diet). Apparent recovery of dietary AA in milk protein followed the same trends, being greater for the DMP diets than AMP and generally lower for Lys and Met with the RPAA-supplemented diets versus AMP and DMP. The RPAA were apparently not used for milk protein synthesis in the conditions of this experiment. The AA recoveries in milk protein varied from around 17% (Ala) to 70% (Pro). Milk protein recoveries of essential AA (EAA) were around 54% for the DMP diet and 49% for AMP. The estimated efficiency of utilization of digestible EAA for milk protein synthesis was generally greater for the DMP diets compared with AMP. In this trial, blood plasma Lys and Met were labeled by abomasal pulse-dose of 15N-Lys and 13C-Met (respectively). Analysis of the 15N-Lys and 13C-Met decay curves in plasma indicated trends for a faster extraction of Lys and Met from plasma for the MP-deficient diets, compared with AMP. Overall, this study confirmed conclusions from previous analyses that the efficiency of utilization of dietary EAA will increase with decreasing MP-AA supply.","author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"C"},{"family":"Giallongo","given":"F"},{"family":"Hristov","given":"A N"},{"family":"Lapierre","given":"H"},{"family":"Cassidy","given":"T W"},{"family":"Heyler","given":"K S"},{"family":"Varga","given":"G A"},{"family":"Parys","given":"C"}],"citation-key":"Lee2015","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2014-8496","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"PMID":"25547302","title":"Effect of dietary protein level and rumen-protected amino acid supplementation on amino acid utilization for milk protein in lactating dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","volume":"98"},

Eighty-eight prepartum cows (36 primiparous and 52 multiparous cows) were blocked by parity and expected calving date and assigned to 1 of 4 treatments arranged factorially. Treatments were a prepartum diet (12% crude protein on a dry matter basis) without (Pre−) or with supplemental RPLys (10 g of digestible Lys/cow per day) and RPMet (4 g of digestible Met/cow per day; Pre+) followed by postpartum diets (16% crude protein on a dry matter basis) without (Post−) or with supplemental RPLys (26 g of digestible Lys/cow per day) and RPMet (11 g of digestible Met/cow per day; Post+). Prepartum, only 2 treatments were applied, but postpartum cows received treatments of Pre−Post−, Pre−Post+, Pre+Post−, or Pre+Post+. During the prepartum period, treatment did not affect dry matter intake and body weight. During the postpartum period, milk protein content was greater (3.23 vs. 3.11%) for Post+ compared with Post− independent of prepartum treatment. However, dry matter intake, body weight, milk yield, and yields of milk components were not affected by Post+ versus Post−. No effects of prepartum treatment or interactions between pre- and postpartum treatments were observed on postpartum performance of cows. No effects of pre- and postpartum supplementation of RPLys and RPMet on performance during the carryover period were found except prepartum supplementation of RPLys and RPMet decreased somatic cell count (4.60 vs. 4.83; log10 transformed) compared with Pre− in the postpartum period and this effect continued during the carryover period [i.e., 4.42 and 4.55 (log10 transformed) for Pre+ and Pre−, respectively]. Prepartum supplementation of RPLys and RPMet increased or tended to increase plasma concentration of Lys, Met, and branched-chain AA compared with Pre− in prepartum cows. Cows on Post+ tended to have greater plasma Lys concentration compared with Post−, but plasma Met concentration was not affected. Health events of postpartum cows were not affected by treatments. In conclusion, we did not observe positive effects of supplementing with RPLys and RPMet on performance of prepartum and postpartum cows. However, prepartum supply of RPLys and RPMet may have potential to improve udder health and immune status of fresh cows.","author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"C."},{"family":"Lobos","given":"N.

Results showed that dietary MMT supplementation decreased (P<0.05) free LPS concentrations in plasma, feces, and the digesta of different sectors of the gastrointestinal tract except the cecum. Dietary YCW supplementation decreased (P<0.05) free LPS concentrations in plasma, feces, and the digesta of the lower gut including the ileum, cecum and colon. Correspondingly, the levels of acute phase proteins (serum amyloid-A, haptoglobin, C-reactive protein, and LPS-binding protein) in plasma were also decreased (P<0.05) by dietary supplementation of MMT and YCW. Dietary supplementation of YCW increased (P<0.05) apparent digestibilities of acid detergent fiber and total phosphorus and improved (P<0.05) average daily gain and feed efficiency. Dietary supplementation of MMT only improved feed efficiency (P<0.05). Results suggest dietary supplementation of MMT and YCW can effectively bind LPS in the digestive tract, reduce the translocation of LPS from the digestive tract into the circulation, and thus improve growth performance in beef cattle. Dietary supplementation of YCW at a dose of 2. g/kg was more effective than that of MMT at the same dose in reducing plasma acute phase protein levels and in improving growth performance. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.","author":[{"family":"Lei","given":"C.

Contents of extractable phenols (g/kg dry matter) were the highest in buckwheat flowers (88), followed by leaves (63), and the lowest in ryegrass (8). The levels of production of total gas and volatile fatty acids demonstrated that the nutritional value of buckwheat was slightly lower than that of ryegrass. Compared to ryegrass alone, ruminal transformation of dietary protein-N into ammonia was lower with 50 mg rutin, buckwheat flowers and buckwheat leaves. Thus, these treatments appeared to have partly protected dietary protein from ruminal degradation. Rutin, at the highest level, buckwheat flowers and the total aerial fraction of the buckwheat plant suppressed methane per unit of total gas by >10%, either at elevated (rutin) or reduced total gas volume. This indicates that the ways of the influence on the ruminal fermentation pattern differed between pure rutin and buckwheat. In vivo studies have to confirm these potentially beneficial effects of buckwheat if used as forage for ruminants and clarify the role of further phenolic compounds present in buckwheat.","author":[{"family":"Leiber","given":"F."},{"family":"Kunz","given":"C."},{"family":"Kreuzer","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"Leiber2012","container-title":"Czech Journal of Animal Science","ISBN":"1212-1819","ISSN":"12121819","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"10-18","title":"Influence of different morphological parts of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) and its major secondary metabolite rutin on rumen fermentation in vitro","type":"article-journal","volume":"57"},

  {"id":"Leiva2017","abstract":"ABSTRACT This study compared vaginal temperature, physiologic, and productive parameters in lactating dairy cows supplemented or not with Omnigen-AF (Phibro Animal Health, Teaneck, NJ) during the summer months in a tropical environment. Thirty-two lactating, primiparous (n = 16) and multiparous (n = 16) pregnant Holstein × Gir cows were ranked by parity, days in milk, body weight, and body condition score (BCS), and assigned to receive (SUPP; n = 16) or not (CON; n = 16) Omnigen-AF (Phibro Animal Health, Teaneck, NJ) at 56 g/cow daily (as-fed basis). During the experimental period (d −6 to 56), cows were maintained in a single drylot pen with ad libitum access to water and a total mixed ration, and milked twice daily. Cows received Omnigen-AF mixed with 200 g of corn (as-fed basis) after the daily morning milking through self-locking head gates, whereas CON cows concurrently received 56 g of kaolin mixed with 200 g of corn. For feed intake evaluation, cows from both treatments were randomly divided in 4 groups of 8 cows each, and allocated to 8 individual feeding stations for 3 d. Intake was evaluated 4 times per group from d 1 to 56. From d −6 to 0, d 15 to 28, and d 43 to 56, cow vaginal temperature was recorded hourly. Environmental temperature-humidity index (THI) was also recorded hourly from d 15 to 28 and d 43 to 56. Cows were evaluated for body weight and BCS on d −6 and 56, individual milk production was recorded daily from d −6 to 56, and milk samples were collected on d −6, 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, and 56 for analyses of somatic cell count and milk components. Blood samples were collected on d −6, −3, 0, 9, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 36, 45, 48, 51, 54, and 56. Results from samples or observations collected from d −6 to 0 were included as an independent covariate in each respective analysis. Environmental THI was 74.2 ± 0.5 and cows were exposed to THI &gt;68 for 633 h within a total of 672 h of evaluation. Cows assigned to CON had greater vaginal temperature on d 28, 43, 45, and from d 48 to 55 (by 0.38 to 0.52%), as well as greater mean somatic cell count (by 97%) and serum haptoglobin concentrations (by 89%) compared with SUPP cows. Cows assigned to SUPP had greater mean dry matter intake (by 7%), BCS on d 56 (by 11%), and mean serum insulin concentrations (by 35%) compared with CON cows. Hence, SUPP ameliorated hyperthermia, improved nutritional status, and modulated systemic and mammary gland immune parameters in lactating dairy cows exposed to heat stress conditions.","author":[{"family":"Leiva","given":"T."},{"family":"Cooke","given":"R.F."},{"family":"Brandão","given":"A.P."},{"family":"Schubach","given":"K.M."},{"family":"Batista","given":"L.F.D."},{"family":"Miranda","given":"M.F."},{"family":"Colombo","given":"E.A."},{"family":"Rodrigues","given":"R.O."},{"family":"Junior","given":"J.R.G."},{"family":"Cerri","given":"R.L.A."},{"family":"Vasconcelos","given":"J.L.M."}],"citation-key":"Leiva2017","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2016-12258","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"4829-4838","PMID":"28434746","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Supplementing an immunomodulatory feed ingredient to modulate thermoregulation, physiologic, and production responses in lactating dairy cows under heat stress conditions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030217303296","volume":"100"},

  {"id":"leso2023","abstract":"Allowing dairy cattle to access pasture or outdoor areas is known to be beneficial for cows' welfare and is considered important by the general public. However, in confinement-based operations with high-yielding cows, pasture access may be difficult to implement, especially for lactating animals. Providing pasture access to heifers and dry cows seems a more feasible option for most farms. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of providing high-yielding dairy cows with free-choice pasture access during the dry period on their health, behavior, and milk production. Over the study period, a total of 78 Holstein cows were assigned to 1 of 2 treatments during the dry period (51 ± 8 d): housing with free-choice access to the pasture (PAST) or housing continuously without any access to the outdoors (CTRL). After calving, all cows from both treatments were mixed and housed continuously. To assess the effects of the treatment on cows' performance, all animals enrolled were monitored both before calving and during the first 100 d in milk of the following lactation. The behavior of all cows involved was monitored continuously during the whole observation period using collar-based sensors. All cows were inspected monthly to assess lameness, hock lesions, cleanliness, and body condition score. During the period after calving (0–100 d in milk), milk production and composition were also monitored. Results showed that free-choice pasture access affected cows' feeding behavior. Before calving, the animals in PAST spent more time feeding than in CTRL and, interestingly, this difference tended to persist for several weeks after calving. During the dry period, cows in PAST were cleaner than in CTRL but no differences in locomotion and body condition score were found between the 2 groups. Free-choice pasture access during the dry period also affected milk production during the following lactation. The cows that spent the dry period in PAST produced more milk than CTRL counterparts, particularly for the animals that calved during summer. In the current study we have found that providing free-choice pasture access during the dry period can positively affect the performance of dairy cattle and represents a desirable practice in confinement-based dairy production systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Leso","given":"Lorenzo"},{"family":"Andrade","given":"Rafaella R."},{"family":"Bambi","given":"Gianluca"},{"family":"Becciolini","given":"Valentina"},{"family":"Barbari","given":"Matteo"}],"citation-key":"leso2023","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2022-23107","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,1]]},"page":"7954-7964","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Free-choice pasture access for dry cows: Effects on health, behavior, and milk production","title-short":"Free-choice pasture access for dry cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002203022300440X","volume":"106"},

To investigate these two approaches, we picked two representative programs: PedPhase and fastPHASE, respectively, for each approach. PedPhase is a rule-based method focusing on the haplotyping constraints within each pedigree and solving them using integer linear programming. fastPHASE is a statistical method based on the clustering property of haplotypes in a population over short regions. It is believed that with family information, one can obtain more accurate phasing results with considerably more cost for genotyping additional family members. Our results indicate that, though only relying on the constraints within each family (with four members) individually, PedPhase has better phasing accuracy than fastPHASE, even when the total numbers of genotyped individuals are the same. But for missing genotype imputation, fastPHASE performs better than PedPhase by taking population information into consideration. The relative influence of family constraints and population information on haplotyping accuracy as shown in this report provides some empirical bases on assessing the trade-off of genotyping family data under different settings.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jing"}],"citation-key":"Li2007a","container-title":"BMC proceedings","ISSN":"1753-6561","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",1]]},"page":"S55","PMID":"18466555","title":"Comparison of haplotyping methods using families and unrelated individuals on simulated rheumatoid arthritis data.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2367580&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","volume":"1 Suppl 1"},

  {"id":"Li2012","abstract":"The effects of a grain-based subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) challenge (GBSC) and an alfalfa-pellet SARA challenge (APSC) on fermentation and endotoxins in the rumen and in the cecum, as well as on endotoxins in peripheral blood, were determined. Six nonlactating Holstein cows with cannulas in the rumen and cecum were used in the study. A 3×3 Latin square arrangement of treatments with 4-wk experimental periods was adopted. During the first 3 wk of each experimental period, all cows received a diet containing 70% forages [dry matter (DM) basis]. In wk 4 of each period, cows received 1 of the following 3 diets: the 70% forage diet fed during wk 1 to 3 (control), a diet in which 34% of the dietary DM was replaced with grain pellets made of 50% ground wheat and 50% ground barely (GBSC), or a diet in which 37% of dietary DM was replaced with pellets of ground alfalfa (APSC). Rumen pH was monitored continuously using indwelling pH probes, and rumen fluid, blood, cecal digesta, and fecal grab samples were collected immediately before feed delivery at 0900 h and at 6 h after feed delivery on d 3 and 5 of wk 4. The time for which rumen pH was below 5.6 was 56.4, 225.2, and 298.8 min/d for the control, APSC, and GBSC treatments, respectively. Compared with the control, SARA challenges resulted in similar reductions in cecal digesta pH, which were 7.07, 6.86, and 6.79 for the control, APSC, and GBSC treatments, respectively. Compared with the control, only GBSC increased starch content in cecal digesta, which averaged 2.8, 2.6, and 7.4% of DM for the control, APSC, and GBSC, respectively. Free lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (LPS) concentration in rumen fluid increased from 10,405 endotoxin units (EU)/mL in the control treatment to 30,715 and 168,391 EU/mL in APSC and GBSC, respectively. Additionally, GBSC increased the LPS concentration from 16,508 to 118,522 EU/g in wet cecal digesta, and from 12,832 to 93,154 EU/g in wet feces. The APSC treatment did not affect LPS concentrations in cecal digesta and feces. All concentrations of LPS in blood plasma were below the detection limit of >0.05 EU/mL of the technique used. Despite the absence of LPS in blood, only GBSC increased the concentration of LPS-binding protein in blood plasma, which averaged, 8.9, 9.5, and 12.1mg/L for the control, APSC, and GBSC treatments, respectively. This suggests that GBSC caused translocation of LPS from the digestive tract but that LPS was detoxified before entering the peripheral blood circulation. The higher LPS concentration in cecal digesta in the GBSC compared with the APSC suggests a higher risk of LPS translocation in the large intestine in GBSC than in APSC.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"S."},{"family":"Khafipour","given":"E."},{"family":"Krause","given":"D.O."},{"family":"Kroeker","given":"A."},{"family":"Rodriguez-Lecompte","given":"J.C."},{"family":"Gozho","given":"G.N."},{"family":"Plaizier","given":"J.C."}],"citation-key":"Li2012","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2011-4447","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"294-303","PMID":"22192209","title":"Effects of subacute ruminal acidosis challenges on fermentation and endotoxins in the rumen and hindgut of dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030211007016","volume":"95"},
  {"id":"Li2016","abstract":"The effects of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product (SCFP) on microbial fermentation in the digestive tract, milk production, and inflammation response were determined in Holstein dairy cows under normal and subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) conditions. Eight lactating dairy cows with ruminal and cecal cannulas were used in a cross-over design with 5 wk experimental periods. During the first experimental period, cows were randomly assigned to treatment, i.e. SCFP (Original XPC, Diamond V, Cedar Rapids, IA) or control. During the second experimental period, treatments were reversed. Experimental periods were separated by a two-week wash out period. During each period, the 4 cows on the SCFP treatment were supplemented with 14. g/d of SCFP in 126. g of ground corn, whereas the other four cows received 140. g ground corn only. During the first 4 wk of each experimental period, all cows received a basal diet. During week 5 of both experimental periods, a SARA challenge was conducted in all cows by replacing 208. g/kg of the basal diet with pellets of ground wheat and barley (50:50 on a weight basis). This SARA challenge increased the duration of rumen pH below 5.6 from 11.1 to 311.1. min/d, indicating successful induction of SARA. Inducing SARA reduced milk fat from 3.24 to 2.82%, and lowered the acetate to propionate ratio from 3.07 to 1.74 in rumen fluid, from 5.13 to 4.57 in cecal digesta, and from 4.81 to 4.34 in feces. Induction of SARA increased milk protein content from 3.23 to 3.32%, without a concomitant effect on milk protein yield. Inducing SARA also increased endotoxic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rumen fluid, cecal digesta and feces from 15,389 to 123,296 endotoxin units (EU)/mL, from 31,982 to 77,380. EU/mL, and from 29,679 to 77, 371. EU/mL, respectively. Concentrations of LPS, serum amyloid A, haptoglobin, and LPS-binding protein increased by 215.0, 250.6, 181.6 and 47.5%, respectively, in peripheral blood when SARA was induced. The SCFP did not affect feed intake, yields of milk, milk fat, and milk protein but it reduced the variation in rumen pH during control feeding. During the SARA challenge, SCFP tended to reduce ruminal LPS at 6. h after feed delivery, increased milk fat percentage (2.71 vs 2.92%, control vs SCFP), and reduced the extent of SARA-associated inflammation response as indicated by a reduction in the concentration of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (0.09 vs 0.03. ng/mL, control vs SCFP). This shows that SCFP can attenuate some of the impact of SARA on production and health of dairy cows.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"S."},{"family":"Yoon","given":"I."},{"family":"Scott","given":"M."},{"family":"Khafipour","given":"E."},{"family":"Plaizier","given":"J.

Twelve Holstein cows (age, 4–5 yrs; bodyweight, 515 ± 42 kg; milk yield, 16.1 ± 3.7 kg/d)in late gestation were allotted to one of 2 treatments. The treatments were a basal diet plus 200 g/d of RPG (450 g/kg of glucose, 450 g/kg of coating fat and 100 g/kg of water) or a basal diet plus 90 g/d of coating fat (CON). Treatments were applied from 1 wk before to 2 wk after calving. Animal performance data were recorded, and the overall tract apparent digestibility of prepartum or postpartum cows was determined. Blood was sampled on d −4, 0, 7, and 14 to examine the plasma biochemical parameters and proinflammatory cytokines. The RPG supplementation increased the milk yield, but did not change the dry matter intake. Compared with cows in the CON group, the plasma total protein concentration was lower in the RPG group. Cows in the RPG group had greater plasma albumin concentrations but lower globulin and interleukin-8 concentrations during the transition period. The RPG supplementation tended to increase the plasma alanine aminotransferase concentration but did not change the plasma aspartate aminotransferase concentration. Dietary RPG supplementation increased the non-esterified fatty acid concentration and tended to decrease the plasma glucose concentration. In conclusion, these results indicate that supplementation with 200 g RPG per day improves milk production and reduces inflammatory markers but might have compromised the liver function of the transition cows in this study.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"X.

In the first experiment, 369 cows were fed 15 g/day of RPC between 25 days pre-calving and 80 days post calving. In the second experiment, 578 primigravid cows were fed 15 g/day of RPC for the last 21 days of gestation only. In both experiments, P/AI were evaluated for the first and second inseminations, and health disorders were monitored daily until 90 days after calving. Return to cyclicity was evaluated in experiment 1 only, on days 51 and 61 post calving. In the first experiment, feeding RPC reduced the incidence of clinical ketosis, mastitis, and morbidity, and the number of cases of mastitis per cow. Feeding RPC did not influence cyclicity and P/AI. In the second experiment, cows fed RPC tended to have greater morbidity than controls because of an increased incidence of metritis and fever, although the incidence of retained fetal membranes was lower. The P/AI for first and second inseminations were similar between treatments. Supplementing the diets of dairy cattle with RPC from before until after calving improved the health of early lactation cows.

The study design was a 2×2 factorial design with 10 cows per treatment. Treatments were WS total mixed ration (TMR) ad libitum, OG TMR ad libitum, WS TMR restricted, and OG TMR restricted. The WS TMR (dry matter basis) contained 30% WS, 20.7% corn silage, 10.0% alfalfa hay, 18.2% ground corn, 16.8% soybean meal, and 4.3% molasses mineral mix (14.7% CP, 1.5Mcal/kg of net energy for lactation, 37.0% neutral detergent fiber). The OG TMR contained 30% OG, 46.2% corn silage, 10.0% alfalfa hay, 9.5% soybean meal, and 4.3% molasses (14.2% CP, 1.5Mcal/kg of net energy for lactation, 41.0% neutral detergent fiber). Cows received 1 lactation diet after calving (17.7% CP, 1.6Mcal/kg of net energy for lactation, 27.3% neutral detergent fiber). Total diet DMI prepartum was higher for ad libitum than for restricted as designed, but forage source had no effect on DMI. Total tract apparent digestibilities of DM and NDF were greater for OG than for WS. Postpartum DMI expressed as a percentage of body weight for the first week of lactation was higher for ad libitum than for restricted diets. Postpartum DMI during the first 30d of lactation was higher for OG than for WS, but no effect was observed for the amount fed prepartum. Milk yield during the first week of lactation was higher for OG than for WS; however, during the first 30d, 3.5% fat-corrected milk yield and yield of milk fat were highest for OG TMR restricted and WS TMR ad libitum. Prepartum treatments had a limited effect on pre- and postpartum lipid metabolism; however, cows fed WS TMR ad libitum had the highest postpartum β-hydroxybutyrate. Eating behavior was observed by 10-min video scans of 24-h video surveillance for 5d pre- and postpartum. Prepartum eating time and eating bouts tended to be greater by WS than for OG, and postpartum eating time per kilogram of neutral detergent fiber intake tended to be greater for WS than for OG.

The objectives were to determine if forage or pre- and postpartum supplement alters periparturient intake, energy balance, and milk yield. Sixty (n = 15) multiparous dairy cows were used in a randomized complete block design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments to compare WS versus GH diets supplemented with either DF or LF. Dietary treatments were (1) WS prepartum + DF pre- and postpartum (WSDF), 2) WS prepartum + LF pre- and postpartum (WSLF), (3) GH prepartum + DF pre- and postpartum (GHDF), and (4) GH prepartum + LF pre- and postpartum (GHLF). Treatments began at dry-off, 42 d before expected calving. During the prepartum phase, cows maintained dry matter intake (DMI) at 2.0% of body weight and prepartum energy balance remained positive for all treatments until calving. Prepartum GH diets had a more positive energy balance compared with WS diets. On week -5, energy balance was more positive for GHDF than for WSDF or GHLF. Energy balance for WSLF, however, was lower on week -3 and -1 than GHDF. Liquid feed decreased dry matter digestibility and increased prepartum liver triglyceride, serum nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), and tended to increase β-hydroxybutyrate. After calving, LF decreased DMI and energy balance, but not yield of milk or 3.5% fat-corrected milk, resulting in greater feed efficiency compared with DF. Forage did not affect postpartum DMI, but milk yield tended to be higher for WS versus GH. The DMI expressed as percentage of body weight was not affected by supplement or prepartum forage type. Cows fed WS had lower serum NEFA, higher liver glycogen, and tended to have a lower triglyceride to glycogen ratio postpartum than GH. Serum NEFA peaked on d 14 for all treatments and then declined thereafter. In postpartum diets, more particles were retained on the top screen for LF (>19.0 mm) of the Penn State Particle Separator, which also tended to have more particles in the second screen (particles 19.0-8.0 mm). Supplement had minimal effect on postpartum selective particle consumption. In conclusion, feeding diets containing WS resulted in lower postpartum serum NEFA, higher liver glycogen, and a tendency for greater milk production and lower liver triglyceride to glycogen than those containing GH. Liquid feed reduced postpartum DMI but not yield of milk yield or 3.5% fat-corrected milk yield, resulting in an improvement in feed efficiency. Future research should continue to investigate the use of single dry cow diet feeding strategies as they affect pre- and postpartum animal responses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Litherland","given":"N B"},{"family":"Silva","given":"D N L","non-dropping-particle":"da"},{"family":"Hansen","given":"W P"},{"family":"Davis","given":"L"},{"family":"Emanuele","given":"S"},{"family":"Blalock","given":"H"}],"citation-key":"Litherland2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5998","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,13]]},"page":"3050-3063","PMID":"23498001","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effects of prepartum controlled-energy wheat straw and grass hay diets supplemented with starch or sugar on periparturient dairy cow performance and lipid metabolism.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23498001","volume":"96"},
  {"id":"Little2007","abstract":"Background & Aims: The effects of fat on gastric emptying (GE), gut hormones, and energy intake are dependent on digestion to free fatty acids (FFAs). In animals, small intestinal oleic acid inhibits energy intake more potently than the triacylglyceride (TG) triolein, but there is limited information about the comparative effects of FFA and TG in human beings. We compared the effects of FFA and TG on GE, gut hormone secretion, appetite, and energy intake in healthy males. Methods: Nine men (age, 23 ± 2 y; body mass index, 22 ± 1 kg/m2) were studied on 3 occasions to evaluate the effects of (1) 40 g oleic acid (FFA, 1830 kJ), (2) 40 g macadamia oil (TG, 1856 kJ; both 600-mL oil-in-water emulsions stabilized with 4% milk protein and labeled with 15 MBq 123I), or (3) 600 mL 4% milk protein (control, 352 kJ), administered intragastrically, on GE, plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) and peptide-YY (PYY) levels, appetite perceptions, and subsequent energy intake. Results: GE of FFA was much slower than that of TG (P < .05), with greater retention of FFA, than TG, in the proximal stomach (P < .001). Hunger was less (P < .05), and fullness was greater (P < .05), after FFA when compared with control and TG. Increases in plasma CCK and PYY levels were greater after FFA than TG or control (P < .05). Energy intake tended to be less after FFA compared with TG (control, 4754 ± 610 kJ; TG, 5463 ± 662 kJ; FFA, 4199 ± 410 kJ).

  {"id":"Little2016","abstract":"When cows with a “higher” body condition score (BCS) are oversupplied with energy during the dry period, postpartum energy balance is normally reduced, which can have a detrimental effect on immune competence and increase the infectious disease risk. However, within grassland-based systems higher yielding cows frequently have a low BCS at drying off. The effects on performance, health, and metabolic and immune functions of providing additional energy to cows with low BCS during the dry period is less certain. To address this uncertainty, 53 multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows (mean BCS of 2.5; 1–5 scale) were allocated to 1 of 2 treatments at dry-off: silage only or silage plus concentrates. Cows on the silage-only treatment were offered ad libitum access to medium-quality grass silage. Cows on the silage-plus-concentrate treatment were offered ad libitum access to a mixed ration comprising the same grass silage plus concentrates [in a 75:25 dry matter (DM) ratio], which provided a mean concentrate DM intake of 3.0kg/cow per day. Postpartum, cows were offered a common mixed ration comprising grass silage and concentrates (in a 40:60 DM ratio) for a 70-d period. Offering concentrates during the dry period increased DM intake, tended to increase energy balance, and increased body weight (BW) and BCS gain prepartum. Offering concentrates during the dry period increased BW and BCS loss postpartum and tended to increase milk fat percentage and serum nonesterified fatty acid concentration, but it did not affect postpartum DM intake, energy balance, and milk yield. Although the percentage of phagocytosis-positive neutrophils did not differ, neutrophils from cows on the silage-plus-concentrate treatment had higher phagocytic fluorescence intensity at 1 and 2 wk postpartum and higher phagocytic index at 1 wk postpartum. Serum haptoglobin concentrations and IFN-γ production by pokeweed mitogen stimulated whole blood culture were unaffected by treatment, although haptoglobin concentrations increased and IFN-γ production decreased peripartum. Offering concentrates during the dry period increased the incidence of lameness postpartum, although other health and fertility parameters were unaffected. In conclusion, supplementing low BCS cows with concentrates during the dry period had no effect on performance and fertility and resulted in a higher neutrophil phagocytic index at 1 wk postpartum and an increased incidence of lameness compared with offering cows a grass silage–only diet prepartum.","author":[{"family":"Little","given":"M.W."},{"family":"O’Connell","given":"N.E."},{"family":"Welsh","given":"M.D."},{"family":"Barley","given":"J."},{"family":"Meade","given":"K.G."},{"family":"Ferris","given":"C.P."}],"citation-key":"Little2016","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2016-11071","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"7102-7122","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Prepartum concentrate supplementation of a diet based on medium-quality grass silage: Effects on performance, health, fertility, metabolic function, and immune function of low body condition score cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-11071","volume":"99"},

  {"id":"Liu2011","abstract":"The experimental knowledge on efficacy, possible modes of action and aspects of application of Chinese herbs as feed additives for animal production are reviewed in this article. Chinese herbs commonly contain protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamins, and mineral which are necessary nutrients to the growth of animal. Polysaccharide, organic acid, alkaloids, and essential oils involved in Chinese herbs can improve the immune function of livestock. Currently, numerous studies have demonstrated anti-oxidative and anti-microbial efficacy and the assumption that Chinese herbs may improve the flavor of meat, which has been confirmed by some observations, but the mode of this action is still unclear. Moreover, several observations support the hypothesis that herbal feed additives may favorably affect gut functions (e.g., enzyme activity, microbial eubiosis) in vitro. Such effects may explain a considerable number of practical studies with livestock reporting improved production performance after providing herbal feed additives. In summary, available evidence indicates that herbal feed additives may have the potential to add to the set of non-antibiotic growth promoters for use in livestock, such as organic acids and probiotics. However, a systematic approach toward the efficacy, mode of action and safety of herbal compounds used as feed additives for animal production seems to be required in the future. © 2011 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.","author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Hua Wei"},{"family":"Tong","given":"Jian Ming"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Dao Wei"}],"citation-key":"Liu2011","container-title":"Agricultural Sciences in China","DOI":"10.1016/S1671-2927(11)60118-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"title":"Utilization of Chinese Herbal Feed Additives in Animal Production","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/utilization-chinese-herbal-feed-additives-animal-production"},
  {"id":"Liu2021","abstract":"Our objective was to quantify the contribution of body weight (BW) change to the overall response of lactating dairy cows to a shortage of dietary protein. Lactating Holstein cows (n = 166; 92 primiparous, 74 multiparous) with initial milk yield of 41 ± 10 kg/d were fed high and low-protein diets in 7 blocks. Blocks were repeated in the same crossover design with periods of 28 to 35 d. Production of 69 of the 166 cows (42 primiparous, 27 multiparous) was also measured in late lactation. Low-protein diets were 14% crude protein (CP) in peak lactation and 13% CP in late lactation and were formulated to contain adequate rumen-degradable protein to maintain rumen function but inadequate rumen undegradable protein for the average cow in this study. High-protein diets were 18% CP in peak lactation and 16% CP in late lactation and contained extra expeller soybean meal to meet metabolizable protein requirements. Body weight changes were used to predict body energy and protein changes, which were added to milk components to calculate total captured energy and protein. Fixed effects of diet, parity, treatment sequence nested in each block, treatment period nested in block, interaction of diet and parity, and the random effects of block and cow nested within block were included in the model to compare cow responses to diets within each lactation stage. In peak lactation, reducing protein from 18 to 14% resulted in estimated daily losses of 2.9 Mcal of milk energy, 2.2 Mcal of body energy, 127 g of milk protein, and 16 g of body protein. Therefore, BW loss accounted for 43% of the decrease in captured energy and 11% of the decrease in captured protein when cows were fed deficient protein. In late lactation, BW loss accounted for 51% of the decrease in captured energy and 14% of the decrease in captured protein when cows were fed deficient protein. We suggest that BW change should be considered when assessing cow responses to changes in dietary protein.","author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"E."},{"family":"Hanigan","given":"M.

Twenty-four animals (221 ± 20.9 kg of BW, and 184 ± 9.9 days of age) were individually assigned to one of four treatments according to a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement: conditioning (with or without acidification) and disinfection (with or without chlorination). The entire study lasted 210 days. Physicochemical and microbiological water quality, water and feed consumption, haematological and biochemical blood parameters, and apparent total tract digestibility were measured; data were analysed via a mixed-effects model. Chlorination and acidification increased (P = 0.02) free residual chlorine in water, and chlorination reduced (P = 0.01) total coliform and Clostridium perfringens counts in water. Treatment did not affect water consumption, total DM intake, or blood parameters. At the beginning of the study, NDF digestibility decreased (P = 0.04) with acidification, however, this was restored at the end of the study. The second study evaluated the potential benefit of drinking water chlorination and acidification on the performance of crossbred Holstein bulls fed high-concentrate diets under commercial conditions. Ninety-six animals (322 ± 35.0 kg of BW, and 220 ± 14.2 days of age) were allocated into six pens assigned to one of the two treatments: untreated drinking water or drinking water treated with chlorination and acidification for a total of 112 days.

  {"id":"Lock2013","abstract":"Previous work has indicated that dietary palmitic acid (C16:0) may increase milk fat yield. The effect of a dietary C16:0-enriched fat supplement on feed intake, yield of milk and milk components, and feed efficiency was evaluated in an experiment with a crossover arrangement of treatments with 25-d periods. A fermentable starch challenge on the last 4d of each period was utilized as a split-plot within period. Sixteen mid-lactation Holstein cows (249 ± 33 d in milk) were assigned randomly to treatment sequence. Treatments were either a C16:0-enriched (~85% C16:0) fat supplement (fatty acid treatment, FAT, 2% dry matter) or a control diet (CON) containing no supplemental fat. Diets containing dry ground corn grain were fed from d 1 through 21 of each period. On the last 4d of each period, dry ground corn was replaced by high-moisture corn grain on an equivalent dry matter basis to provide a fermentable starch challenge. Response variables were averaged for d 18 to 21 (immediately before the fermentable starch challenge) and d 22 to 25 (during the fermentable starch challenge). We observed no treatment effects on milk yield or milk protein yield. The FAT treatment increased milk fat concentration from 3.88 to 4.16% and fat yield from 1.23 to 1.32 kg/d compared with CON. The FAT treatment decreased dry matter intake by 1.4 kg/d and increased conversion of feed to milk (3.5% fat-corrected milk yield/dry matter intake) by 8.6% compared with CON. The increase in milk fat yield by FAT was entirely accounted for by a 27% increase in 16-carbon fatty acid output into milk. Yields of de novo and preformed fatty acids were not affected by FAT relative to CON. The fermentable starch challenge did not affect milk fat concentration or yield. Results demonstrate the potential for a dietary C16:0-enriched fat supplement to improve milk fat concentration and yield as well as efficiency of conversion of feed to milk. Further studies are required to verify and extend these results and to determine whether responses are similar across different diets and levels of milk production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",5,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Lock","given":"a L"},{"family":"Preseault","given":"C L"},{"family":"Rico","given":"J E"},{"family":"DeLand","given":"K E"},{"family":"Allen","given":"M S"}],"citation-key":"Lock2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2013-6892","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",10]]},"page":"6650-9","PMID":"23958004","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Feeding a C16:0-enriched fat supplement increased the yield of milk fat and improved conversion of feed to milk.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23958004","volume":"96"},

  {"id":"loftenInvitedReviewPalmitic2014","abstract":"Energy is the most limiting nutritional component in diets for high-producing dairy cows. Palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids have unique and specific functions in lactating dairy cows beyond a ubiquitous energy source. This review delineates their metabolism and usage in lactating dairy cows from diet to milk production. Palmitic acid is the fatty acid (FA) found in the greatest quantity in milk fat. Dietary sources of C16:0 generally increase milk fat yield and are used as an energy source for milk production and replenishing body weight loss during periods of negative energy balance. Stearic acid is the most abundant FA available to the dairy cow and is used to a greater extent for milk production and energy balance than C16:0. However, C18:0 is also intimately involved in milk fat production. Quantifying the transfer of each FA from diet into milk fat is complicated by de novo synthesis of C16:0 and desaturation of C18:0 to oleic acid in the mammary gland. In addition, incorporation of both FA into milk fat appears to be limited by the cow's requirement to maintain fluidity of milk, which requires a balance between saturated and unsaturated FA. Oleic acid is the second most abundant FA in milk fat and likely the main unsaturated FA involved in regulating fluidity of milk. Because the mammary gland can desaturate C18:0 to oleic acid, C18:0 appears to have a more prominent role in milk production than C16:0. To understand metabolism and utilization of these FA in lactating dairy cows, we reviewed production and milk fat synthesis studies. Additional and longer lactation studies on feeding both FA to lactating dairy cows are required to better delineate their roles in optimizing milk production and milk FA composition and yield.","author":[{"family":"Loften","given":"J R"},{"family":"Linn","given":"J G"},{"family":"Drackley","given":"J K"},{"family":"Jenkins","given":"T C"},{"family":"Soderholm","given":"C G"},{"family":"Kertz","given":"A F"}],"citation-key":"loftenInvitedReviewPalmitic2014","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2014-7919","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"PMID":"24913651","title":"Invited review: palmitic and stearic acid metabolism in lactating dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","volume":"97"},
  {"id":"logan2019","abstract":"ABSTRACT: Previous research has determined that maintaining young animals in stalls is detrimental to their bone health, while the addition of 50 to 82-m sprints 5 d/week aids in counteracting the reduction of bone strength from confinement. The current research aims to determine if 1 or 3 d/week of sprinting affords the same benefits to bone as 5 d/week of sprinting compared to animals confined with no sprinting. Twenty-four Holstein bull calves were obtained from the Michigan State University Dairy Cattle Teaching and Research Center. At 9 wk of age, calves were randomly assigned to treatments of 1, 3, or 5 d/week of sprint exercise, or to the confined control group sprinted 0 d/week. Each treatment had 6 calves. Individual sprinting bouts included a single sprint down a 71-m concrete aisle. For the duration of the 6-wk study, calves were housed at the MSU Beef Cattle Teaching and Research Center in stalls which afforded calves room to stand, lay down, and turn around. Serum was collected weekly via jugular venipuncture to obtain concentrations of osteocalcin (OC) and C-telopeptide crosslaps of type I collagen (CTX-1)—markers of bone formation and degradation, respectively. Sprints were videotaped weekly to determine stride frequency and sprint velocity. On day 42, calves were humanely euthanized at the Michigan State University Meat Lab and both front limbs were immediately harvested. Computed tomography scans and mechanical testing were performed on the left fused third and fourth metacarpal bones. Serum OC concentration was greatest for calves sprinted 5 d/week (P < 0.001). Calves sprinted 5 d/week had both greater stride frequency (P < 0.05) and lower sprint velocity (P < 0.05). All exercise treatments experienced greater dorsal cortical widths compared to control animals (P < 0.01). Through mechanical testing, fracture forces of all sprinting treatments were determined to be greater than the control treatment (P < 0.02). Results from this study support that sprinting 1, 3, or 5 d/week during growth can increase bone health and cause favorable alterations in bone markers. While all exercise treatments had over a 20% increase to fracture force, calves sprinted 1 d/week sprinted only 426 m over the 6-wk study and still experienced over a 20% increase in bone strength compared to confined calves. This study demonstrates the remarkably few strides at speed needed to enhance bone strength and emphasizes the danger to skeletal strength if sprinting opportunities are not afforded.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Logan","given":"Alyssa A"},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Brian D"},{"family":"Robison","given":"Cara I"},{"family":"Manfredi","given":"Jane M"},{"family":"Buskirk","given":"Daniel D"},{"family":"Schott","given":"Harold C"},{"family":"Hiney","given":"Kristina M"}],"citation-key":"logan2019","container-title":"Journal of Animal Science","DOI":"10.1093/jas/skz202","ISSN":"0021-8812, 1525-3163","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,30]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","page":"3300-3312","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Calves, as a model for juvenile horses, need only one sprint per week to experience increased bone strength","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/97/8/3300/5522250","volume":"97"},
  {"id":"Lohrenz2010","abstract":"Feeding rumen-protected fat (RPF) can improve energy supply for dairy cows but it affects glucose metabolism. Glucose availability is a precondition for high milk production in dairy cows. Therefore, this study investigated endocrine regulation of glucose homeostasis and hepatic gene expression related to glucose production because of RPF feeding in lactating cows. Eighteen Holstein dairy cows during second lactation were fed either a diet containing RPF (mainly C16:0 and C18:1; FD; n = 9) or a control diet based on corn starch (SD; n = 9) for 4 wk starting at 98 d in milk (DIM). Feed intake and milk yield were measured daily and milk composition once a week. Blood samples were taken weekly for analyses of plasma triglyceride, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), β-hydroxybutyrate, bilirubin, urea, lactate, glucose, insulin, and glucagon. At 124 DIM, an intravenous glucose tolerance test (GTT; 1g/kg of BW(0.75)) was performed after a 12-h period without food. Blood samples were taken before and 7, 14, 21, and 28 min after glucose administration, and plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, and glucagon were measured. Glucose half-life as well as areas under the concentration curve for glucose, insulin, and glucagon were calculated. After slaughter at d 28 of treatment, liver samples were taken to measure mRNA abundance of pyruvate carboxylase, cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and facilitative glucose transporter 2. Dry matter intake, but not energy and protein intake, was lower in FD than in SD. Milk yield during lactation decreased more in SD than in FD, and milk protein was lower in FD than in SD. Plasma concentrations of triglycerides and NEFA were higher in FD than in SD. Plasma insulin concentrations were lower and the glucagon:insulin ratios were higher in FD than in SD. Fasting glucose concentration before GTT was lower, and fasting glucagon concentrations tended to be higher in FD than in SD. In liver, fat content tended to be higher and G6Pase mRNA abundance was lower in FD than in SD. Lower hepatic G6Pase mRNA abundance was associated with reduced fasting plasma glucose concentrations, but the glucose-induced insulin response was not affected by RPF feeding. Hepatic G6Pase gene expression might be affected by DMI and might be involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis in dairy cows, resulting in a lower hepatic glucose output after RPF feeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Lohrenz","given":"a-K"},{"family":"Duske","given":"K"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"F"},{"family":"Nürnberg","given":"K"},{"family":"Losand","given":"B"},{"family":"Seyfert","given":"H M"},{"family":"Metges","given":"C C"},{"family":"Hammon","given":"H M"}],"citation-key":"Lohrenz2010","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2010-3342","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",12]]},"page":"5867-76","PMID":"21094760","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Milk performance and glucose metabolism in dairy cows fed rumen-protected fat during mid lactation.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21094760","volume":"93"},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect on immune function and blood metabolite concentration of limiting milk production in early lactation to reduce negative energy balance. Twenty-two multiparous Holstein cows were milked either once a day (1x) or twice a day (2x) for the first week postpartum. All cows were milked twice daily for the rest of lactation. Blood concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA), calcium, bilirubin, urea, phosphorus, glucose, leptin, stanniocalcin-1, and 17beta-estradiol were determined in samples collected from 5 wk before scheduled calving to 5 wk after calving. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) were isolated from blood to conduct assays for chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and respiratory burst. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated to evaluate lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-4, and interferon-gamma). Cows milked 1x produced 31% less milk than cows milked 2x during the first week of lactation. Over the following 13 wk of lactation, the milk production of cows milked 1x during the first week was 8.1% lower than for cows milked 2x. However, because the percentages of fat and protein were greater in the milk from 1x cows, the yields of milk components and energy-corrected milk were similar. Calving induced an increase in the concentrations of NEFA, BHBA, urea, and bilirubin. The increases in levels of NEFA and BHBA were greater in cows milked 2x than in cows milked 1x. During the same period, the serum glucose concentration decreased but remained greater in cows milked 1x. Serum calcium on d 4 and serum phosphorus on d 4 and 5 were greater in cows milked 1x. The differences between the 2 groups persisted beyond treatment until postpartum d 24 for NEFA and glucose and until postpartum d 14 for BHBA. After calving, the concentrations of leptin and stanniocalcin-1 decreased. During the first week postpartum, the decrease of leptin was less marked in cows milked 1x. The immune functions of PBMC and PMNL isolated from experimental cows and incubated using a standard medium did not show clear-cut peripartum immunosuppression. These variables were not significantly affected by the treatments, with the exception of interferon-gamma secretion, which was greater on d 5 and 14 in cows milked 1x. In conclusion, limiting milk production in early lactation had positive effects on metabolite concentration, but larger studies are necessary to establish if this could reduce disease incidence.","author":[{"family":"Loiselle","given":"M.C."},{"family":"Ster","given":"C."},{"family":"Talbot","given":"B.G."},{"family":"Zhao","given":"X."},{"family":"Wagner","given":"G.F."},{"family":"Boisclair","given":"Y.R."},{"family":"Lacasse","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"Loiselle2009","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2008-1399","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"page":"1900-1912","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Impact of postpartum milking frequency on the immune system and the blood metabolite concentration of dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2008-1399","volume":"92"},

This study evaluated the accuracy of plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)-factors related to negative energy balance-in predicting decreased fertility. One plasma sample per cow was collected from 480 cows in 12 herds during the period from d 4 to 21 in milk and analyzed for NEFA, BHBA, and IGF-1. For each cow, data on breed, parity, calving date, gynecological examinations, and insemination dates were obtained. Milk samples from 241 cows in 7 of the participating herds were analyzed for progesterone concentration to define the first day of luteal activity. The diagnostic sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) at different cut-off concentrations of NEFA, BHBA, or IGF-1 were calculated and related to individual cow fertility status, measured as anestrus (ANEST), delayed first artificial insemination (DFAI), or delayed conception. Positive and negative predictive values (PV+; PV-) were calculated considering different levels of (within-herd) prevalence. Strata (i.e., sub-group)-specific Se and Sp and associations between test results and fertility parameters were investigated using logistic regression. The NEFA and BHBA tests for ANEST and DFAI had the highest combined Se and Sp and were thus evaluated further. Cut-off values with Sp around 80% were used in this step to provide a reasonable number of test-positive cows, representing a practical situation. This corresponded to a cut-off value for the NEFA test of 400 µEq/L (Se 0.27-0.45) and for the BHBA test of 1.8 mM (Se 0.15-0.30) across all cows included in the study. The estimated Sp was generally higher than the original 80%, but the corresponding Se was further decreased when the test was used in heifers compared with older cows. The true prevalence of ANEST in the study population was 27%, which gave a PV+ of 0.36 to 0.45 and a PV- of 0.76 to 0.79. With 35% true prevalence of DFAI, PV+ was 0.29 to 0.38 and PV- was 0.64 to 0.66. Thus, overall test performance was low when metabolic indicators measured as single values in early lactation were used to predict fertility in dairy cows, but accuracy was influenced by cow-level factors such as parity. The prevalence of the target condition (in this case, decreased fertility) also influences test usefulness and should be considered when planning test systems and interpreting test results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Lomander","given":"H"},{"family":"Gustafsson","given":"H"},{"family":"Svensson","given":"C"},{"family":"Ingvartsen","given":"K L"},{"family":"Frössling","given":"J"}],"citation-key":"Lomander2012","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5534","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",9,26]]},"page":"7086-7096","PMID":"23021753","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Test accuracy of metabolic indicators in predicting decreased fertility in dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23021753","volume":"95"},

Measurements of body condition score (BCS) and heart girth (HG) were obtained at approximately 2 and 5 wk pp and at time of first insemination. The effects of supplemental feeding with GLY or PG on the plasma concentrations of glucose, NEFA, BHBA, insulin, and IGF-1, and BCS, HG, and occurrence of disease were analyzed. No differences in BCS or HG or in plasma concentrations of glucose, BHBA, NEFA, or IGF-1 were found between the control group and any of the treatment groups. Cows in the GLY group had lower plasma insulin concentrations during DIM 0 to 63 compared with group CON, but no difference in insulin was found between the PG group and the CON group. Cows supplemented with GLY had a higher milk yield (kg of milk and kg of energy-corrected milk) during the first 90 DIM. Cows in the PG group tended to yield more milk during the same period.

Reduced yields of 8:0-16:0 and cis9-18:1\nfatty acids accounted for 69 and 17%, respectively,\nof the decrease in milk fat yield with HC vs. LC\n(-90 g/d), and for 26 and 33%, respectively, of the\ndecrease with HCO vs. LCO (-400 g/d). Total\ntrans-18:1 yield increased by 25 (HCO) and 59 (LCO)\ng/d with oil addition. Trans10-18:1 yield was 5-fold\ngreater with high-concentrate diets. Trans11-18:1\nincreased by 13 (HCO) and 19 (LCO) g/d with oil\naddition. Trans13+14-18:1 yield increased by 9 (HCO)\nand 18 (LCO) g/d with linseed oil. Yield of total\nconjugated linoleic acids (CLA) in milk averaged 6\ng/d with LC or HC compared with 14 g/d with LCO or\nHCO. Cis9,trans11-CLA yield was not affected by\nconcentrate level but increased by 147% in response\nto oil. Feeding oil increased yields of\ntrans11,cis13-, trans11,trans13-, and\ntrans,trans-CLA, primarily with\nLCO. Trans10,cis12-CLA yield (average of 0.08 g/d)\nwas not affected by treatments. Yield of\ntrans11,cis15-18:2 was 1 g/d in cows fed LC or HC\nand 10 g/d with LCO or HCO. Yields of\ncis9,trans11-18:2, cis9,trans12-18:2, and\ncis9,trans13-18:2 were positively correlated (r =\n0.74 to 0.94) with yields of trans11-18:1,\ntrans12-18:1, and trans13+14-18:1,\nrespectively.

The soybean sources were conventional, high-linoleic-acid variety extruded soybean meal (ESBM; 8.7% ether extract with 15% oleic and 54% linoleic acids); extruded Plenish (DuPont Pioneer, Johnston, IA), high-oleic-acid variety soybean meal (EPSBM; 8.4% ether extract with 73% oleic and 8% linoleic acids); and whole, heated Plenish soybeans (WPSB; 20.2% ether extract). The study involved 15 Holstein cows in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design experiment with three 28-d periods. The inclusion rate of the soybean sources in the diet was (dry matter basis) 17.1, 17.1, and 7.4% for ESBM, EPSBM, and WPSB, respectively, which resulted in ether extract concentration of the diets of 3.99, 3.94, and 4.18%, respectively. Compared with ESBM, the Plenish diets tended to increase dry matter intake and decreased feed efficiency (but had no effect on energy-corrected milk feed efficiency). The Plenish diets increased milk fat concentration on average by 5.6% and tended to increase milk fat yield, compared with ESBM. The WPSB diet tended to increased milk true protein compared with the extruded soybean meal diets. Treatments had no effect on rumen fermentation and enteric methane or carbon dioxide emissions, except pH was higher for WPSB versus EPSBM. The Plenish diets decreased the prevalence of Ruminococcus and increased that of Eubacterium and Treponema in whole ruminal contents. Total-tract apparent digestibility of organic matter and crude protein were decreased by WPSB compared with ESBM and EPSBM. Compared with the other treatments, urinary N excretion was increased by EPSBM and fecal N excretion was greater for WPSB. Treatments had marked effects on milk fatty acid profile. Generally, the Plenish diets increased mono-unsaturated (mostly cis-9 18:1) and decreased polyunsaturated, total trans-, and conjugated linoleic fatty acids concentrations in milk fat. In this study, compared with conventional, high-linoleic-acid variety extruded soybean meal, the Plenish soybean diets increased milk fat concentration and tended to increase fat yield, decreased feed efficiency, and modified milk fatty acid profile in a manner expected from the greater concentration of oleic acid in Plenish soybean oil.","author":[{"family":"Lopes","given":"J.C."},{"family":"Harper","given":"M.T."},{"family":"Giallongo","given":"F."},{"family":"Oh","given":"J."},{"family":"Smith","given":"L."},{"family":"Ortega-Perez","given":"A.M."},{"family":"Harper","given":"S.A."},{"family":"Melgar","given":"A."},{"family":"Kniffen","given":"D.M."},{"family":"Fabin","given":"R.A."},{"family":"Hristov","given":"A.N."}],"citation-key":"Lopes2017","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2016-11911","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"1122-1135","PMID":"27988126","title":"Effect of high-oleic-acid soybeans on production performance, milk fatty acid composition, and enteric methane emission in dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030216308876","volume":"100"},

  {"id":"lopreiatoRoleNutraceuticalsTransition2020","abstract":"The transition period of dairy cattle is characterized by a number of metabolic, endocrine, physiologic, and immune adaptations, including the occurrence of negative energy balance, hypocalcemia, liver dysfunction, overt systemic inflammatory response, and oxidative stress status. The degree and length of time during which these systems remain out of balance could render cows more susceptible to disease, poor reproductive outcomes, and less efficient for milk production and quality. Studies on both monogastrics and ruminants have reported the health benefits of nutraceuticals (e.g. probiotics, prebiotics, dietary lipids, functional peptides, phytoextracts) beyond nutritional value, interacting at different levels of the animal's physiology. From a physiological standpoint, it seems unrealistic to disregard any systemic inflammatory processes. However, an alternate approach is to modulate the inflammatory process per se and to resolve the systemic response as quickly as possible. To this aim, a growing body of literature underscores the efficacy of nutraceuticals (active compounds) during the critical phase of the transition period. Supplementation of essential fatty acids throughout a 2-month period (i.e. a month before and a month after calving) successfully attenuates the inflammatory status with a quicker resolution of phenomenon. In this context, the inflammatory and immune response scenario has been recognized to be targeted by the beneficial effect of methyl donors, such as methionine and choline, directly and indirectly modulating such response with the increase of antioxidants GSH and taurine. Indirectly by the establishment of a healthy gastrointestinal tract, yeast and yeast-based products showed to modulate the immune response, mitigating negative effects associated with parturition stress and consequent disorders. The use of phytoproducts has garnered high interest because of their wide range of actions on multiple tissue targets encompassing a series of antimicrobial, antiviral, antioxidant, immune-stimulating, rumen fermentation, and microbial modulation effects. In this review, we provide perspectives on investigations of regulating the immune responses and metabolism using several nutraceuticals in the periparturient cow.","author":[{"family":"Lopreiato","given":"Vincenzo"},{"family":"Mezzetti","given":"Matteo"},{"family":"Cattaneo","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Ferronato","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Minuti","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Trevisi","given":"Erminio"}],"citation-key":"lopreiatoRoleNutraceuticalsTransition2020","container-title":"Journal of Animal Science and Biotechnology","DOI":"10.1186/s40104-020-00501-x","ISSN":"20491891","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,27]]},"PMID":"32864127","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","title":"Role of nutraceuticals during the transition period of dairy cows: A review","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"Lucy2001","abstract":"The dairy industry in the United States has changed dramatically in the last decade. Milk production per cow has increased steadily because of a combination of improved management, better nutrition, and intense genetic selection. Dairy farms are larger, and nearly 30% of the dairy cows in the United States are on farms with 500 or more cows. The shift toward more productive cows and larger herds is associated with a decrease in reproductive efficiency. Cows with the greatest milk production have the highest incidence of infertility, but epidemiological studies suggest that, in addition to milk production, other factors are probably decreasing reproductive efficiency in our dairy herds. The reproductive physiology of dairy cows has changed over the past 50 yr, and physiological adaptations to high milk production may explain part of the reproductive decline. Critical areas for new research include control of the estrous cycle, metabolic effects of lactation on reproduction, mechanisms linking disease to reproduction, and early embryonic mortality. Solving reproductive loss in dairy cows will not be easy because only a small number of research groups study reproduction in postpartum dairy cows. Therefore, the present research base will need to be expanded. For this to occur, research funding must be increased above its current level and a renewed emphasis must be placed on solving the emerging crisis of infertility in dairy cows.","author":[{"family":"Lucy","given":"M C"}],"citation-key":"Lucy2001","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(01)70158-0","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",6]]},"page":"1277-93","PMID":"11417685","title":"Reproductive loss in high-producing dairy cattle: where will it end?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11417685","volume":"84"},
  {"id":"lucy2008","abstract":"Contents\n            \n              Growth hormone (GH) and insulin‐like growth factor‐I (IGF‐I) control growth and lactation in cattle and swine. Insulin participates in the endocrinology of growth and lactation because insulin and GH are antagonistic in their actions. Dairy cows experience a period of negative energy balance during the first 4–8 weeks post‐partum. During this period, their somatotropic axis (comprised of GH, the GH receptor and IGF‐I) becomes uncoupled and there is elevated GH and diminished IGF‐I in the circulation. Blood insulin concentrations are low as well. Sows are different from dairy cows because their somatotropic axis remains coupled during lactation and both GH and IGF‐I are elevated. Nonetheless, sows that become catabolic during lactation will have reduced IGF‐I concentrations. Sows are inseminated after weaning so their metabolic state is different from post‐partum beef and dairy cows that are inseminated when they are lactating. Dairy cows are fed\n              ad libitum\n              and naturally have low IGF‐I during lactation. Sows have elevated IGF‐I when they are well‐fed. A threshold of IGF‐I protein in follicular fluid may be met by local ovarian (paracrine/autocrine) and endocrine sources of IGF‐I. Nutritionally induced changes in insulin and in liver IGF‐I secretion that arise from perturbations of the somatotropic axis have a direct effect on the ovary through the endocrine actions of insulin and IGF‐I. Sows and cows that are nutritionally compromised have low concentrations of insulin and IGF‐I in their blood and this theoretically reduces ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropins. Although sows are inseminated after weaning, there appear to be carry‐over effects of the previous lactation on the ovarian follicular populations that develop after the sow is weaned. Understanding the mechanisms through which metabolic hormones control ovarian function may lead to improved reproductive management of both pigs and cattle because lactation and post‐partum reproduction are closely tied in both species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Lucy","given":"Mc"}],"citation-key":"lucy2008","container-title":"Reproduction in Domestic Animals","container-title-short":"Reprod Domestic Animals","DOI":"10.1111/j.1439-0531.2008.01140.x","ISSN":"0936-6768, 1439-0531","issue":"s2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",7]]},"language":"en","license":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","page":"31-39","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Functional Differences in the Growth Hormone and Insulin‐like Growth Factor Axis in Cattle and Pigs: Implications for Post‐partum Nutrition and Reproduction","title-short":"Functional Differences in the Growth Hormone and Insulin‐like Growth Factor Axis in Cattle and Pigs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2008.01140.x","volume":"43"},

  {"id":"Lueker1961","abstract":"Although there is ample evidence with laboratory animals indicating that the Ca:P ratio in the diet is important, the evidence with ruminants does not consistently indicate detrimental effects from ratios devfiating widely from that thought to be optimum. It is commonly recommended that Ca:P ratios in the diets of l;aboratory animals be between 2:1 adn 1:2 although with adequate vitamin D, ratios outside these limits may be satisfacotry (maynard adn Loosli, '56). With dairy cattle, ratios up to 10:1 have produced no ill effects on milk production and calcium and phosphorus balance (Haag et al., '32; Lamb et al., '34). Using body weight gains of beef cattle as the criterion of response, Dowe et al. ('57) observed that a Ca:P ratio of 9.1:1 resulted in significantly lower gains than a ratio of 4.3:1. The inorganic phosphorus content of the plasma however, was not depressed below a level considered to be adequate. It was therefore concluded that excess calcium depressed gains by a detrimental effect upon nutrients other than phosphorus. Marston ('39) reviewed the early work and Duncan ('58) has reviewed and summarized more recent work on the role of calcium and phosphorus in ruminant nutrition. There is not complete agreement on the relative effect of amount and  of the ratio of calcium to phosphorus upon absorption and excretion of these two elements. Since much of the earlier work on this and related problems was done using gains in boy weight, balances and blood levels as measures of response, it seemed desireable to study directly the effect of various ratios of calcium to phosphorus upon absorption using the isotope dilution technique for measuring absorption. This paper reports the results of such studies.","author":[{"family":"Lueker","given":"C E"},{"family":"Lofgreen","given":"G P"}],"citation-key":"Lueker1961","container-title":"J.

Long milking intervals greater than 16h have a negative effect on milk yield and udder health. The impact of 2 systems of pasture allocation in AMS on milking interval and yield was investigated at the FutureDairy AMS research farm (Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute, New South Wales Department of Primary Industries, Camden, New South Wales, Australia) in late November to early December 2010. Two- (2WG) versus 3-way grazing (3WG) allocations per 24-h period were compared in a field study to test the hypothesis that an increase in the frequency of pasture allocation would reduce the milking interval and, therefore, increase milking frequency. The study involved the entire milking herd of 145 cows, with (mean ± SD) DIM=121±90d, 7-d average milking frequency=1.52±0.41 milkings/cow per day, and 7-d average milk yield=21.3±7.6kg/cow per day. Cows were milked using 2 DeLaval VMS milking units (DeLaval International AB, Tumba, Sweden). Cows in the 3WG treatment had 31% reduced milking interval, 40% greater milking frequency, and 20% greater daily milk production compared with 2WG. Increased milking frequency and milk production for 3WG was associated with greater utililization levels of the AMS milking units throughout the day. These results support the recommendation that, wherever possible, farmers installing AMS should incorporate sufficient infrastructure to accommodate 3WG, which provides additional flexibility with managing extremely long (and short) milking intervals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Lyons","given":"N","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Kerrisk","given":"K L"},{"family":"Garcia","given":"S C"}],"citation-key":"Lyons2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2013-6716","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",7]]},"page":"4494-504","PMID":"23684034","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Comparison of 2 systems of pasture allocation on milking intervals and total daily milk yield of dairy cows in a pasture-based automatic milking system.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23684034","volume":"96"},

Milking events with intervals beyond 16h have been reported to have a negative effect on milk yield and udder health, and therefore it is important to minimize their occurrence. As feed is the main incentive to encourage cow traffic around the system, a study was conducted to compare pre- (PRE) versus postmilking (POST) supplementary feed placement strategies in a pasture-based automatic milking system. We hypothesized that PRE cows would have a stronger incentive to walk voluntarily from the paddock to the dairy facility to get milked (due to the reward being more immediate), thereby reducing their milking interval and increasing daily milking frequency and milk yield. The PRE cows returned to the dairy facility sooner (PRE=11.9 vs. POST=13.27h) but had longer milking intervals (PRE=15.3 vs. POST=14.28h). This was due to the additional time spent in the prefeeding area (PRE=56 versus POST=23min) combined with a longer average time spent in the premilking waiting yard (PRE=97 versus POST=77min). Treatment did not affect daily milk yield per cow.

Twenty-four Holstein Ã— Angus, 1- to 2-d-old calves (38.46 Â± 0.91 kg initial body weight [BW]) were assigned two treatment groups: control or SCFP treated, milk replacer with 1 g/d SCFP (SmartCare) and calf starter top-dressed with 5 g/d SCFP (NutriTek). The study consisted of one 31-d period. On days 19 to 21 of the supplementation period, calves were challenged via aerosol inoculation with BRSV strain 375. Calves were monitored twice daily for clinical signs, including rectal temperature, cough, nasal and ocular discharge, respiration effort, and lung auscultation. Calves were euthanized on day 10 postinfection (days 29 to 31 of the supplementation period) to evaluate gross lung pathology and pathogen load. Supplementation with SCFP did not affect BW (P = 0.762) or average daily gain (P = 0.750), percentages of circulating white blood cells (P < 0.05), phagocytic (P = 0.427 for neutrophils and P = 0.460 for monocytes) or respiratory burst (P = 0.119 for neutrophils and P = 0.414 for monocytes) activity by circulating leukocytes either before or following BRSV infection, or serum cortisol concentrations (P = 0.321) after BRSV infection. Calves receiving SCFP had reduced clinical disease scores compared with control calves (P = 0.030), reduced airway neutrophil recruitment (P < 0.002), reduced lung pathology (P = 0.031), and a reduced incidence of secondary bacterial infection. Calves receiving SCFP shed reduced virus compared with control calves (P = 0.049) and tended toward lower viral loads in the lungs (P = 0.051). Immune cells from the peripheral blood of SCFP-treated calves produced increased (P < 0.05) quantities of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in response to toll-like receptor stimulation, while cells from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of SCFP-treated calves secreted less (P < 0.05) proinflammatory cytokines in response to the same stimuli. Treatment with SCFP had no effect on virus-specific T cell responses in the blood but resulted in reduced (P = 0.045) virus-specific IL-17 secretion by T cells in the BAL. Supplementing with SCFP modulates both systemic and mucosal immune responses and may improve the outcome of an acute respiratory viral infection in preweaned dairy calves.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Mahmoud","given":"Asmaa H.A."},{"family":"Slate","given":"Jamison R."},{"family":"Hong","given":"Suyeon"},{"family":"Yoon","given":"Ilkyu"},{"family":"McGill","given":"Jodi L."}],"citation-key":"mahmoud2020","container-title":"Journal of Animal Science","DOI":"10.1093/JAS/SKAA252","ISSN":"15253163","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,1]]},"PMID":"32780814","publisher":"Oxford University Press","title":"Supplementing a saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product modulates innate immune function and ameliorates bovine respiratory syncytial virus infection in neonatal calves","type":"article-journal","volume":"98"},

Cows were housed in a freestall barn, fed once a day and milked twice a day. The experiment consisted of five 14-d periods: d 1 through 7 were considered for data collection, and d 8 through 14 were considered a wash-out phase. In each period, cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 dietary treatments: (1) control (CON), consisting of a basal total mixed ration (TMR); (2) high-dose NSP diet (NSP-1%), consisting of TMR plus 230g of NSP; (3) aflatoxin diet (AFD), consisting of the TMR plus AF challenge; (4) low-dose NSP with AF (NSP-0.5%+AFD), composed of TMR plus 115g of NSP and AF challenge; and (5) high-dose NSP with AF (NSP-1%+AFD), consisting of TMR plus 230g of NSP and AF challenge. The AF challenge consisted of top dressing a daily dose of 100 µg/kg estimated dry matter intake (DMI); similarly, NSP was fed at 1.0 or 0.5% of estimated DMI. Milk yield and DMI were similar across treatments averaging 21.1±1.33kg/d and 19.7±0.56kg/d, respectively. Concentration of milk fat, protein, and lactose were similar across treatments with averages of 4.91±0.20%, 3.85±0.10%, and 4.70±0.06%, respectively. Concentration of vitamin A averaged 0.28±0.03 µg/mL and riboflavin concentration averaged 1.57±0.13 µg/mL across treatments. The concentration of minerals in milk were similar for all treatments. Cows fed CON and NSP-1% yielded the lowest concentration of AFM1 in milk with 0.03 and 0.01±0.06 µg/L. Addition of NSP reduced milk AFM1 from 1.10±0.06 µg/L with the AF diet to 0.58 and 0.32±0.06 µg/L with the NSP-0.5%+AF and NSP-1%+AF diets, respectively. Excretion of AFM1 was reduced by NSP; mean values were 24.38, 11.86, 7.38, 0.64, and 0.23, ± 1.71 µg/d, for AFD, NSP-0.5%+AFD, NSP-1%+AFD, NSP-1%, and CON, respectively. More specifically, 1.07±0.08% of the daily AF intake was transferred to the milk of cows consuming the AFD, whereas the AF transfer rates in milk from cows that consumed the NSP-0.5%+AFD and NSP-1%+AFD were 0.52 and 0.32±0.08%. Results from this research demonstrate that feeding NSP to lactating cows is an effective method to reduce the transfer and excretion of AFM1 in milk with no negative effects on dry matter intake, milk production, and composition.","author":[{"family":"Maki","given":"C.R."},{"family":"Thomas","given":"A.D."},{"family":"Elmore","given":"S.E."},{"family":"Romoser","given":"A.A."},{"family":"Harvey","given":"R.B."},{"family":"Ramirez-Ramirez","given":"H.A."},{"family":"Phillips","given":"T.D."}],"citation-key":"Maki2016","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2015-10242","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"1039-1046","PMID":"26709170","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Effects of calcium montmorillonite clay and aflatoxin exposure on dry matter intake, milk production, and milk composition","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-10242","volume":"99"},

All heifers underwent FTAI by using the \"Show-Me-Synch\" protocol [controlled internal drug release (CIDR) insert from d 0 to 14 followed by PGF(2α) (25mg i.m.) 16d after insert removal (d 30) with GnRH (100 µg i.m.) and FTAI at 66 h after PGF(2α)]. A single professional technician performed the FTAI. Heifers were fitted with heat detection patches at PGF(2α) to characterize estrous response. Estrous response did not differ between CON (63/120; 53%) and SS (70/120; 58%) treatments. The CON heifers, however, achieved greater FTAI P/AI (82/120; 68%) compared with SS (45/120; 38%) heifers. The P/AI did not differ for CON heifers that exhibited or failed to exhibit estrus before FTAI [44/63 (70%) vs. 38/57(67%), respectively]. For SS heifers, however, those that exhibited estrus had greater P/AI compared with those that failed to exhibit estrus [32/70 (46%) vs. 13/50 (26%)]. Pregnancy per AI resulting from FTAI was greater for heifers that were inseminated with CON semen compared with those that received SS semen. The expression of estrus before FTAI did not affect P/AI when CON semen was used, whereas the P/AI with SS semen was greater for heifers detected in estrus. Further studies are required to develop strategies for using sex-sorted semen when inseminating heifers at predetermined fixed times on the basis of expression of estrus before FTAI.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Mallory","given":"D","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Lock","given":"S L"},{"family":"Woods","given":"D C"},{"family":"Poock","given":"S E"},{"family":"Patterson","given":"D J"}],"citation-key":"Mallory2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5850","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",2]]},"page":"854-6","PMID":"23219125","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Hot topic: Comparison of sex-sorted and conventional semen within a fixed-time artificial insemination protocol designed for dairy heifers.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23219125","volume":"96"},
  {"id":"Mangwe2019","abstract":"The aim of the present research was to compare milk fatty acid composition of cows grazing perennial ryegrass-white clover pasture (RGWC), with that of cows grazing alternative forages of chicory or plantain. Fifty-four cows, balanced for milk solids, days in milk and bodyweight, were divided evenly into replicated groups of six cows/group. Cows grazing chicory or plantain had similar estimated dry-matter intake (17.7 kg DM/cow.day) and milk-solid (MS) yield (1.93 kg MS/cow.day), which were greater (P < 0.05) than for cows grazing RGWC (15.6 kg DM/cow.day and 1.65 kg MS/cow.day). Milk produced from cows grazing chicory or plantain contained greater proportions of omega-3 fatty acids (FA) than that from cows on RGWC (P < 0.01), despite lower omega-3 FA in herbage. RGWC increased the percentage of conjugated linoleic and vaccenic acids in milk compared with those of milk produced from herbs (P < 0.01). This reflects the greater percentage of α-linolenic acid in RGWC (P ≤ 0.02) than in forage herbs. The changes in FA profile from the herbage to the milk suggests less biohydrogenation in cows grazing the herbs. Forage herbs demonstrated the potential benefit to alter milk FA composition, while increasing milk production.","author":[{"family":"Mangwe","given":"M. C."},{"family":"Bryant","given":"R.

  {"id":"Mann2015","abstract":"© 2015 American Dairy Science Association. The objective was to investigate the effect of different dry cow feeding strategies on the degree of ketonemia postpartum. Epidemiologic studies provide evidence of an association between elevated β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) concentrations in postpartum dairy cows and a decreased risk for reproductive success as well as increased risk for several diseases in early lactation, such as displacement of the abomasum and metritis. The plane of energy fed to cows in the prepartum period has been shown to influence ketogenesis and the degree of negative energy balance postpartum. Our hypothesis was that a high-fiber, controlled-energy diet (C) fed during the dry period would lead to a lower degree of hyperketonemia in the first weeks postpartum compared with either a high-energy diet (H), or a diet where an intermediate level of energy would only be fed in the close-up period (starting at 28. d before expected parturition), following the same controlled-energy diet in the far-off period. Hyperketonemia in this study was defined as a blood BHBA concentration of ≥1.2. mmol/L. Holstein cows (n. =. 84) entering parity 2 or greater were enrolled using a randomized block design and housed in individual tiestalls. All treatment diets were fed for ad libitum intake and contained monensin. Cows received the same fresh cow ration after calving. Blood samples were obtained 3 times weekly before and after calving and analyzed for BHBA and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA). Milk components, production, and dry matter intake were recorded and energy balance was calculated. Repeated measures ANOVA was conducted for the outcomes dry matter intake, energy balance, BHBA and NEFA concentrations, milk and energy-corrected milk yield, as well as milk composition. Predicted energy balance tended to be less negative postpartum in group C and cows in this group had fewer episodes of hyperketonemia compared with both the intermediate group and group H in the first 3 wk after calving. Postpartum BHBA and NEFA concentrations over time were highest in group H and lowest in group C, whereas milk production was not affected by prepartum plane of energy. Analysis of milk fatty acid composition showed a higher yield of preformed fatty acids in group H compared with group C, suggesting higher lipid mobilization for cows fed H. In this study, a 1-group, controlled-energy dry period approach decreased the degree of negative energy balance as well as the number of episodes and degree of hyperketonemia postpartum.","author":[{"family":"Mann","given":"S."},{"family":"Yepes","given":"F.

Our hypothesis was that different dry period diets formulated to resemble current feeding practices on commercial dairy farms and differing in plane of energy would have an effect on IgG and insulin concentration, as well as composition of fatty acid of colostrum. Animals (n=84) entering parity 2 or greater were dried off 57d before expected parturition and fed either a diet formulated to meet, but not greatly exceed energy requirements throughout the dry period (CON), or a higher energy density diet, supplying approximately 150% of energy requirements (HI). A third group received the same diet as group CON from dry-off until 29d before expected parturition. After this time point, from 28d before expected parturition until calving, they received a diet formulated to supply approximately 125% of energy requirements (I-med). Concentration of IgG and insulin in colostrum were measured by radial immunodiffusion and RIA, respectively. Composition of fatty acids was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The IgG concentration was highest in colostrum of cows in group CON [96.1 (95% CI: 83.3-108.9) g/L] and lowest in group HI [72.4 (60.3-84.5) g/L], whereas insulin concentration was highest in group HI [1,105 (960-1,250) μU/mL] and lowest in group CON [853 (700-1,007) μU/mL]. Colostrum yield did not differ between treatments and was 5.9 (4.5-7.4), 7.0 (5.6-8.4), and 7.3 (5.9-8.7) kg in groups CON, I-med, and HI, respectively. A multivariable linear regression model showed the effect of dietary treatment group on IgG concentration was independent of the effect of dry matter. Cows in groups CON, I-med, and HI had an average colostral fat percentage of 5.0 (4.1-5.9), 5.6 (4.8-6.4), and 6.0 (5.2-6.8) and an average fat yield of 289 (196-380), 406 (318-495), and 384 (295-473) g, respectively. Colostrum of cows fed to exceed predicted energy requirements during the last 4wk of the dry period (groups I-med and HI) exhibited a higher concentration and yield of de novo fatty acid and lower concentrations but similar yield of preformed fatty acid compared with cows in group CON. Feeding a controlled energy diet during the dry period increased colostral IgG concentration in this study, whereas overall colostrum yield was not affected. Exceeding energy requirements during the period of colostrogenesis led to higher concentrations of insulin and de novo fatty acid in colostrum.","author":[{"family":"Mann","given":"S"},{"family":"Leal Yepes","given":"F A"},{"family":"Overton","given":"T R"},{"family":"Lock","given":"A L"},{"family":"Lamb","given":"S V"},{"family":"Wakshlag","given":"J J"},{"family":"Nydam","given":"D V"}],"citation-key":"Mann2016","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2015-9926","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"1515-26","PMID":"26709187","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Effect of dry period dietary energy level in dairy cattle on volume, concentrations of immunoglobulin G, insulin, and fatty acid composition of colostrum.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030215009200","volume":"99"},

The objective of our work was to investigate the effect of commonly used hyperketonemia treatments on hepatic triglyceride and glycogen content as well as on the mRNA and protein abundance of key enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis, and lipid metabolism. Multiparous Holstein cows between 3 and 9 d in milk were screened 3 times per week and enrolled in the study when whole-blood β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations measured ≥1.2 mmol/L. Cows were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 groups: (1) 500 mL of a 50% D-glucose solution intravenously once a day for 3 d (n = 8), (2) 300 mL of propylene glycol orally once a day for 3 d (n = 8), (3) 500 mL of a 50% D-glucose solution intravenously and 300 mL of propylene glycol orally once a day for 3 d (n = 8), or (4) an untreated control group (n = 8). Liver biopsies were taken on the day of enrollment as well as on the day following completion of treatments. Liver triglyceride and glycogen content were determined by colorimetric and fluorometric methods, respectively. Gene and protein expression of pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1, glucose-6-phosphatase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A were compared between groups and time points using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and Western blotting techniques, respectively. In addition, the ratio of light chain 3B II:I was determined by Western blotting. Plasma samples from both time points for each enrolled cow were submitted for chemistry analysis. Data were analyzed using a repeated-measures ANOVA taking into account the paired nature of the data, and differences between all groups and time points were controlled for multiple comparisons using the Tukey procedure. No difference was found in triglyceride or glycogen concentration between treatment groups. The gene expression of pyruvate carboxylase decreased in the group receiving both treatments, whereas protein expression of this enzyme increased in all groups over time. The autophagy marker light chain 3B II:I decreased in the group receiving both glucose and propylene glycol. No other changes in gene or protein expression of key hepatic enzymes were associated with treatments. We conclude that intravenous glucose and oral propylene glycol, commonly used treatments for ketosis in postpartum dairy cows, administered alone or in combination for a duration of 3 d did not have important beneficial or detrimental effects on selected indicators of liver composition and function in cows with hyperketonemia.","author":[{"family":"Mann","given":"S."},{"family":"Leal Yepes","given":"F.

Concentrations of BHB were measured in whole blood, and plasma samples were analyzed for glucose, fatty acid (NEFA), insulin, glucagon, and electrolyte concentrations. The EDTA-anticoagulated blood samples were assessed for red blood cell indices, and smears were made for evaluation of red blood cell morphology. Outcomes were analyzed using repeated measures analysis. Overall least squares means (95% CI) of whole blood BHB concentrations between 1 h and d 11 relative to first treatment were 1.11 (0.95 to 1.30), 1.26 (1.07 to 1.47), 0.96 (0.81 to 1.13), and 1.53 (1.30 to 1.80) mmol/L for the GLU, PG, GLU+PG, and CTRL groups, respectively. Treatment with both glucose and propylene glycol led to a greater magnitude and more prolonged decrease in BHB concentrations compared with individual treatments. The NEFA and glucagon concentrations were lower immediately after treatment in GLU and GLU+PG groups compared with CTRL, and treatment with both glucose and propylene glycol was associated with a greater increase in glucose and insulin concentrations immediately after treatment compared with CTRL and GLU treatment alone. Treatments did not lead to differences in plasma mineral concentrations. We conclude that treatments varied in the magnitude of decreasing blood BHB concentrations in hyperketonemic postpartum cows, with the greatest decline after treatment with a combination of intravenous glucose and oral propylene glycol.","author":[{"family":"Mann","given":"S."},{"family":"Yepes","given":"F.

  {"id":"Margerison2003","abstract":"Abnormal oral behaviour in calves is believed to develop when there is a lack of opportunity to suckle, but it is unclear whether they need access to their mother or whether a multiple suckling system will suffice to prevent this behaviour from developing. Therefore, in an initial experiment, the behaviour of calves that suckled their own mother or another cow for 15 min each day was compared with that of artificially-reared calves which had no opportunity to suckle. Cows were mechanically milked twice daily, after which they were either suckled for 15 min by their own calf (Treatment O), multiple-suckled by other cows' calves (Treatment M) or unsuckled with the calves reared artificially (Treatment A). There was no difference between treatments in the time that calves spent consuming milk, but suckling calves consumed less milk than those reared artificially. The incidence of cross-sucking was greater for non-suckled calves (1.8 events/day) than for suckled calves (0.33 events/day, with no difference between Treatments O and M). In the non-suckled calves, cross-sucking was at its highest frequency 1 min after the end of milk-feeding and declined linearly to negligible levels at 13 min post-milk feeding. For calves in this treatment, most (78%) of the cross-sucking was directed at the inguinal region (especially the udder or scrotum) of other calves, whereas in suckled calves, most of the cross-sucking (81%) was directed at the mouths of other calves. The time spent consuming concentrate feed, and the amount of feed consumed, was greater for artificially-reared calves, compared with suckled calves, suggesting that food ingestion could provide a replacement stimulus. In a second experiment, it was observed that before weaning, the time that calves spent licking their pen or bucket increased until feed intake was sufficient to stimulate significant amounts of rumination, after which it declined. It is concluded that cross-sucking of artificially-roared calves, which is derived from motivation to perform sucking in the inguinal region, can be prevented by providing short access to either the calf's dam or another cow for two short periods each day. In the absence of a cow to suckle, the calves lick inanimate objects repeatedly until the consumption of solid food stimulates rumination. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  {"id":"martens2016","abstract":"The pathogenesis of milk fever is characterized by a rapid increase of calcium requirement with onset of colostrum secretion and the delayed signal cascade of the regulation of calcium homeostasis. This reaction is influenced by magnesium and phosphorous intake. Insufficient magnesium intake impairs the release of Parathormon (PTH) and effects of PTH at the target organs. High magnesium intakes avoid magnesium deficiency, exhibit a significant antagonism on calcium transport in rumen and kidney and reduced the incidence of milk fever in epidemiological studies. High phosphorous intake impairs the regulation of calcium homeostasis and lowers calcium concentration at parturition. Low calcium intake (< 50g/d) is a good preventive measure, but hardly to realize, because calcium contents of the diet are high. Calcium digestibility can be reduced by zeolite and phytate and both are able to stabilize blood calcium concentration at parturition. However, zeolite is reducing phosphorous digestibility and voluntary feed intake particularly at high doses. A combination of high magnesium (0.4% in the DM) and low phosphorous (≤ 0.25% in the DM) intake in combination with protected phytate is a promising measure of prevention of milk fever.","author":[{"family":"Martens","given":"Holger"},{"family":"Deiner","given":"Carolin"}],"citation-key":"martens2016","container-title":"Der Praktische Tierarzt","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"de","source":"Zotero","title":"Bedeutung von Magnesium, Phosphor, Zeolith und Phytat bei der Gebärparese der Milchkuh","type":"article-journal"},

Amaferm was added to the incubation bottles (n = 4) at concentrations of 0, .4 or 1.0 g/liter. When mixed ruminal microorganisms were incubated with only Amaferm, the 1.0 g/liter concentration increased the production of hydrogen (H2; P less than .001), methane (CH4; P less than .01), acetate (P less than .05), butyrate (P less than .01), total VFA (P less than .05) and NH3 (P less than .05). Addition of both levels of Amaferm to soluble-starch fermentations tended to enhance the production of H2 (P less than .11), CH4 (P less than .15), acetate (P less than .29) and total VFA (P less than .19); propionate production was increased (P less than .10) by 1.0 g/liter Amaferm, resulting in a decrease (P less than .05) in the acetate:propionate ratio. Fermentation of amino acids plus 1.0 g/liter Amaferm enhanced the production of acetate (P less than .05), propionate (P less than .05), valerate (P less than .01) and total VFA (P less than .10) and decreased the acetate:propionate ratio (P less than .05).

  {"id":"Martineau2013","abstract":"The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine the effects of the substitution of a protein source by canola meal (CM) on lactational responses (CM minus control) in dairy cows. The study included 49 comparisons of isonitrogenous (±1.0% dietary CP content) dietary treatments published since 1975 (27 experiments). The CM intake ranged from 1.0 to 4.0kg/d (standard deviation = 0.65). Regressions were forced through the origin, weighted by sample size, and controlled for changes in dry matter intake and in dietary concentrations of CP and ether extract. Milk yield and milk protein yield responded positively to the substitution of a protein source by CM. The response in milk protein yield was affected by the type of protein source that was substituted; the positive response was half less when CM was substituted for soybean meal compared with substitution of CM for other protein sources. The latter effect was in part related to a positive response on milk protein percentage when CM replaced protein sources other than soybean meal. The response in efficiency of N utilization (milk N yield/N intake) was positive to the substitution of a protein source by CM. Negative changes in supply of metabolizable protein (MP) estimated from the 2001 National Research Council model were associated with positive responses in milk protein yield with CM substitution, a finding contrary to the expected positive relationship between supply of MP and milk protein yield. In conclusion, a protein supplement can be substituted by CM with positive effects on milk and milk protein production. These data also indicate an underestimation of MP supply associated with CM inclusion in dairy rations using the National Research Council model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Martineau","given":"R"},{"family":"Ouellet","given":"D R"},{"family":"Lapierre","given":"H"}],"citation-key":"Martineau2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5740","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3]]},"page":"1701-14","PMID":"23295114","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Feeding canola meal to dairy cows: A meta-analysis on lactational responses.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23295114","volume":"96"},

Blood was sampled on d 0, 1, and 3 postpartum for assessment of neutrophil phagocytic and oxidative burst activities. Blood was also sampled at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 12 DIM for determination of serum concentrations of Ca, K, Mg, nonesterified fatty acids, β-hydroxybutyrate, and glucose. On the basis of receiver operator characteristic curves, subclinical hypocalcemia (SCH) was defined as a serum Ca concentration ≤8.59 mg/dL in at least 1 sample in the first 3 DIM. The overall incidences of metritis and puerperal metritis were 47.3 and 30%, respectively. Concentration in blood and percentages of neutrophils undergoing phagocytosis and oxidative burst were all reduced in cows with SCH compared with normocalcemic cows. Cows with SCH were at a greater risk of developing fever, metritis, and puerperal metritis compared with normocalcemic cows. Among cows at low risk of developing metritis, those with SCH had a greater incidence of metritis (40.7%) compared with normocalcemic cows (14.3%). Similarly, among cows at high risk of developing metritis, cows with SCH had a greater incidence of metritis (77.8%) compared with normocalcemic cows (20.0%). Cows with SCH had elevated concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate compared with normocalcemic cows. The relative risk of developing metritis decreased by 22% for every 1 mg/dL increase in serum Ca. Neither metritis nor SCH influenced the resumption of estrous cyclicity by 38 DIM, but cows with SCH had a reduced pregnancy rate and a longer interval to pregnancy compared with normocalcemic cows.

The sequence of treatments was either NC-SCHI or SCHI-NC, with a 6-d washout period. Ionized Ca was evaluated before, hourly during the infusion period, and at 48 and 72h, to monitor concentrations and adjust the rate of infusion, maintaining blood iCa(2+) <1.0mM in SCHI throughout the 24-h infusion period. Additional measurements included heart and respiratory rates, rectal temperature, dry matter intake, rumen contractions, whole-blood pH, concentrations of glucose and K in whole blood, concentrations of total Ca, Mg, nonesterified fatty acids, β-hydroxybutyrate, and insulin in plasma, and urinary excretion of Ca. Total and differential leukocyte count in blood was also performed. The concentration of cytosolic iCa(2+) in neutrophils and lymphocytes was quantified and neutrophil function was assayed in vitro. Infusion of a 5% EGTA solution successfully induced SCH in all SCHI cows, resulting in decreased blood iCa(2+) concentrations throughout the 24-h treatment period (0.77±0.01 vs. 1.26±0.01mM iCa(2+)).

  {"id":"Martinez2016","abstract":"The objectives of this experiment were to determine the effects of oral Ca supplementation on milk yield, body condition, pregnancy per artificial insemination (P/AI), and days to pregnancy in Holstein cows considered to be of low (LRM; no calving assistance, live singleton without retained placenta) or high (HRM; at least one of the following: dystocia, twins, stillbirth, retained placenta, or vulvo-vaginal laceration) risk of developing metritis. The hypotheses were that oral Ca supplementation during the early postpartum period would reduce the loss of body condition and improve lactation performance and reproduction. Four hundred fifty Holstein cows were blocked by parity as primiparous cows (n = 174) or multiparous cows (n = 276). Within parity, a cow considered at HRM was matched with a cow of LRM and the pair was randomly assigned to control (no Ca supplementation), 86 g of Ca on d 0 and 1 postpartum (CaS1), or 86 g of Ca on d 0 and 1 postpartum followed by 43 g/d on d 2 to 4 postpartum (CaS4). Body condition was scored at calving and 32 d postpartum and estrous cyclicity was evaluated at 38 and 52 d postpartum. Milk yield was recorded daily. Multiparous cows were classified as above or below the mean 305-d mature equivalent milk yield based on production in the previous lactation. Reproductive performance was evaluated for the first 210 d postpartum. Body condition did not differ among treatments, and cows lost on average 0.44 units of body condition in the first month of lactation. Calcium supplementation did not affect milk yield in the first 5 mo postpartum. For multiparous cows, Ca supplementation was beneficial to milk yield in the first 30 DIM in cows of greater production potential, but detrimental to multiparous cows with below average production potential. Calcium supplementation to primiparous cows reduced P/AI at first (control = 55.8, CaS1 = 31.5, CaS4 = 37.0%) and all artificial inseminations (control = 48.5, CaS1 = 34.6, CaS4 = 38.5%); however, Ca supplementation to multiparous cows improved P/AI at the first (control = 32.1, CaS1 = 38.6, CaS4 = 41.3%) and all artificial inseminations (control = 28.1, CaS1 = 35.3, CaS4 = 40.5%). These responses in P/AI to Ca supplementation resulted in extended median days to pregnancy (control = 75, CaS1 = 100, CaS4 = 94 d) and smaller proportion of pregnant cows (control = 89.3, CaS1 = 83.9, CaS4 = 83.9%) in primiparous cows, but shorter days to pregnancy (control = 115, CaS1 = 94, CaS4 = 94 d) and increased proportion of pregnant cows in multiparous cows (control = 67.0, CaS1 = 77.2, CaS4 = 74.3%). Risk of metritis depressed most measures of reproduction evaluated in the experiment. Results indicate that responses to oral Ca supplementation are conditional on parity and production potential of cows. Oral Ca supplementation was detrimental to reproduction in primiparous cows. On the other hand, Ca supplementation benefited reproduction in multiparous cows and milk yield in the cohort of multiparous cows of greater production potential.","author":[{"family":"Martinez","given":"N"},{"family":"Sinedino","given":"L D P"},{"family":"Bisinotto","given":"R S"},{"family":"Daetz","given":"R"},{"family":"Risco","given":"C A"},{"family":"Galvão","given":"K N"},{"family":"Thatcher","given":"W W"},{"family":"Santos","given":"J E P"}],"citation-key":"Martinez2016","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2015-10529","ISSN":"1525-3198","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"1-14","PMID":"27423945","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Effects of oral calcium supplementation on productive and reproductive performance in Holstein cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030216304519/fulltext"},

  {"id":"Maulfair2011","abstract":"The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of feeding rations of different particle sizes on rumen digesta and fecal matter particle size. Four rumen-cannulated, multiparous, Holstein cows (104±15 d in milk) were randomly assigned to treatments in a 4×4 Latin square design. The diets consisted of 29.4% corn silage, 22.9% ground corn, 17.6% alfalfa haylage, and 11.8% dry grass hay [20% of forage dry matter (DM)] on a DM basis. Dry grass hay was chopped to 4 different lengths to vary the total mixed ration (TMR) particle size. Geometric mean particle sizes of the rations were 4.46, 5.10, 5.32, and 5.84 mm for short, medium, long, and extra long diets, respectively. The ration affected rumen digesta particle size for particles ≥3.35 mm, and had no effect on distribution of particles <3.35 mm. All rumen digesta particle size fractions varied by time after feeding, with soluble particle fractions increasing immediately after feeding and 0.15, 0.6, and 1.18-mm particle size fractions decreasing slightly after feeding. Particle fractions >1.18 mm had ration by time interactions. Fecal neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and indigestible NDF concentrations decreased with increasing TMR particle size. Fecal particle size expressed as total geometric mean particle length followed this same tendency. Fecal particle size, expressed as retained geometric mean particle length, averaged 1.13 mm with more than 36% of particles being larger than 1.18 mm. All fecal nutrient concentrations measured were significantly affected by time after feeding, with NDF and indigestible NDF increasing after feeding and peaking at about 12h later and then decreasing to preprandial levels. Starch concentrations were determined to have the opposite effect. Additionally, apparent digestibility of diet nutrients was analyzed and DM digestibility tended to decrease with increasing TMR particle size, whereas other nutrient digestibilities were not different among rations. These results show that the critical size for increased resistance to rumen escape is larger than 1.18 mm and this critical size is constant throughout the day. This study also concludes that, when using average quality grass hay to provide the range of particle sizes fed, DM digestibility tends to decrease with increasing ration particle size.","author":[{"family":"Maulfair","given":"D.D."},{"family":"Fustini","given":"M."},{"family":"Heinrichs","given":"A.J."}],"citation-key":"Maulfair2011","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2010-3718","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"page":"3527-3536","PMID":"21700040","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of varying total mixed ration particle size on rumen digesta and fecal particle size and digestibility in lactating dairy cows1","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030211003481","volume":"94"},
  {"id":"Maulfair2013","abstract":"Ration sorting is thought to affect ruminal fermentation in such a manner that milk yield milk and components are often decreased. However, the influence of ruminally degradable starch on ration sorting has not been studied. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to evaluate the interactions between forage particle size (FPS) and ruminally fermentable carbohydrates (RFC) for dry matter intake (DMI), ration sorting, ruminal fermentation, chewing activity, and milk yield and components. In this study, 12 (8 ruminally cannulated) multiparous, lactating Holstein cows were fed a total mixed ration that varied in FPS and RFC. Two lengths of corn silage were used to alter FPS and 2 grind sizes of corn grain were used to alter RFC. It was determined that increasing RFC increased ruminating time and did not affect eating time, whereas increasing FPS increased eating time and did not affect ruminating time. Ruminal fermentation did not differ by altering either FPS or RFC. However, increasing FPS tended to increase mean and maximum ruminal pH and increasing RFC tended to decrease minimum ruminal pH. Particle size distribution became more diverse and neutral detergent fiber content of refusals increased over time, whereas starch content decreased, indicating that cows were sorting against physically effective neutral detergent fiber and for RFC. Selection indices determined that virtually no interactions occurred between FPS and RFC and that despite significant sorting throughout the day, by 24 h after feeding cows had consumed a ration very similar to what was offered. This theory was reinforced by particle fraction intakes that very closely resembled the proportions of particle fractions in the offered total mixed ration. An interaction between FPS and RFC was observed for DMI, as DMI decreased with increasing FPS when the diet included low RFC and did not change when the diet included high RFC. Dry matter intake increased with RFC for long diets and did not change with RFC on short diets. Increasing RFC was found to increase milk yield, milk protein content and yield, and lactose content and yield but decrease milk fat content. Increasing FPS did not have as great an effect on milk production as RFC. This study found no significant interaction between FPS and RFC for ration sorting, although an interaction between FPS and RFC for DMI was observed. Neither FPS nor RFC affected ruminal fermentation, whereas RFC had a greater influence on milk yield and components than FPS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Maulfair","given":"D D"},{"family":"Heinrichs","given":"a J"}],"citation-key":"Maulfair2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-6048","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,8]]},"page":"3085-3097","PMID":"23477824","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effects of varying forage particle size and fermentable carbohydrates on feed sorting, ruminal fermentation, and milk and component yields of dairy cows(1.)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23477824","volume":"96"},
  {"id":"Maurer2017","abstract":"<p>In this Research Paper we hypothesised that the temporary insulin resistance seen during the transition period in dairy cows may cause significant differences in the efficacy of PG at different sampling periods and that in some cases this effect will be dose dependent. Eighty four sampling sets were generated by studying 7 multiparous Holstein cows repeatedly at 4 sampling periods of 3 d length (dry cows: days 40, 39 and 38 antepartum; close up cows: days 10, 9 and 8 antepartum; fresh cows: days 3, 4 and 5 post-partum; lactating cows: days 38, 39 and 40 post-partum). On each of these days 3 h after morning feeding propylene glycol was drenched in different dosages of 100, 300 or 500 ml once per day (cross over study). The different doses were applied in an alternating order (Latin square). Blood samples were taken before, every 30 min up to 4 h, after 6 and 12 h after PG application. Following parameters have been measured: insulin, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), betahydroxybutyrate (BHB), bilirubin, cholesterol, potassium, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH). Revised Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (RQUICKI) was calculated. It was found that glucose, insulin, NEFA, BHB, bilirubin and potassium concentrations were influenced differently by the three defined dosages of propylene glycol at four different sampling periods. Whereas RQUICKI, cholesterol, AST and GLDH did not differ between the sampling periods and treatments. The major results of the study are that the effect of PG is dose-dependent and that the effect of PG is depending on the time of application according to calving. It can be concluded that in fresh cows higher dosages are necessary to provoke similar effects in comparison to dry, close up and lactating cows. Although the study did not compare to topdressing of PG from the results it is reasonable to believe that bolus application of a specific PG volume is necessary to provoke the effect.</p>","author":[{"family":"Maurer","given":"Michaela"},{"family":"Peinhopf","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Gottschalk","given":"Jutta"},{"family":"Einspanier","given":"Almut"},{"family":"Koeller","given":"Gabor"},{"family":"Wittek","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"Maurer2017","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Research","DOI":"10.1017/S0022029917000486","ISSN":"14697629","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"375-384","title":"Effects of different dosages of propylene glycol in dry cows and cows in early lactation","type":"article-journal","volume":"84"},
  {"id":"Maxin2013","abstract":"Different protein sources, such as canola meal (CM) or dried distillers grains (DDG), are currently used in dairy rations to replace soybean meal (SBM). However, little data exists comparing their rumen degradation in a single study. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare the ruminal degradation of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), and AA of SBM, CM, high-protein corn DDG (HPDDG), and wheat DDG plus solubles (WDDGS). In situ studies were conducted with 4 rumen-fistulated lactating Holstein cows fed a diet containing 38% grass hay and 62% corn-based concentrate. Each protein source was incubated in the rumen of each cow in nylon bags for 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48h to determine DM and CP rumen degradation kinetics, whereas additional bags were also incubated for 16h to evaluate AA ruminal disappearance. Rumen DM and CP degradability was calculated from rumen-undegraded residues corrected or not for small particle loss. Data were fitted to an exponential model to estimate degradation parameters and effective degradability (ED) was calculated with a passage rate of 0.074h(-1). The WDDGS and SBM had higher uncorrected ED (DM=75.0 and 72.6%; CP=84.8 and 66.0%, respectively) than CM and HPDDG (DM=57.2 and 55.5%; CP=59.3 and 48.2%, respectively), due to higher soluble fraction in WDDGS and a combination of higher potentially degradable fraction and rate of degradation in SBM. Correction for small particle loss from bags, higher for WDDGS than for the other protein sources, decreased estimated ED but did not alter feed ranking. The ruminal disappearance of AA after 16h of incubation reflected the overall pattern of CP degradation between protein supplements, but the ruminal disappearance of individual AA differed between protein supplements. Overall, these results indicate that, in the current study, (1) SBM and WDDGS were more degradable in the rumen than CM and HPDDG, and (2) that small particle loss correction is relevant but does not alter this ranking.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Maxin","given":"G"},{"family":"Ouellet","given":"D R"},{"family":"Lapierre","given":"H"}],"citation-key":"Maxin2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-6392","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",8]]},"page":"5151-60","PMID":"23769369","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Ruminal degradability of dry matter, crude protein, and amino acids in soybean meal, canola meal, corn, and wheat dried distillers grains.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23769369","volume":"96"},
  {"id":"Maynou2018","abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of oral acidogenic mineral boluses (196 g) containing anionic salts to facilitate the transition from lactation to the dry stage by inducing a mild and temporary metabolic acidosis at dry-off. In experiment 1, 84 lactating cows were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 treatment groups consisting of an oral administration of 0, 1, or 2 boluses 5 d before dry-off to evaluate the effects on milk production. In experiment 2, 16 lactating cows were involved in a crossover study to evaluate the effects of the administration of 2 boluses on milk production, feed intake, and urine pH. In experiment 3, 152 lactating cows were allocated to 1 of 2 treatments (control: no treatment; bolus: 2 oral boluses the day before last milking) to evaluate udder pressure, incidence of milk leakage, and lying behavior during the first days following dry-off. Also, milk yield in the subsequent lactation for all enrolled cows was recorded during the first 60 DIM. In experiment 1, cows receiving 2 boluses had the greatest reduction in milk production (-2.56 kg/d of milk) compared with those receiving 1 bolus or no treatment (-1.15 and -0.23 kg/d, respectively) the second day after bolus application. In experiment 2, the application of oral boluses decreased feed intake of cows during the first 3 d following treatment, and milk production was reduced on d 2 and 3 after bolus application. Reduced urine pH at 8 and 24 h after treatment was observed in bolus cows compared with control cows. In experiment 3, bolus cows had lower udder pressure after drying off, but incidence of milk leakage did not differ between treatments. Bolus cows had an additional 85 min of lying time in the 24 h following dry-off. Serum P and β-OH-butyrate concentrations were lower in bolus cows than in control cows after dry-off, but no other differences in blood parameters between treatments were observed. Also, no differences in milk yield in the subsequent lactation were observed between treatments. It is concluded that oral bolus application diminishes feed intake and milk production, and, if applied at dry-off, it decreases udder pressure and increases lying time during the first 24 h after dry-off.","author":[{"family":"Maynou","given":"G"},{"family":"Elcoso","given":"G"},{"family":"Bubeck","given":"J"},{"family":"Bach","given":"A"}],"citation-key":"Maynou2018","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2018-15058","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"1-12","PMID":"30243631","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Effects of oral administration of acidogenic boluses at dry-off on performance and behavior of dairy cattle.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30243631","volume":"0"},

Cows from 4 freestall dairy herds (2 in New York and 2 in Wisconsin) were each tested 6 times for SCK from 3 to 16 DIM using the Precision Xtra meter (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). Subclinical ketosis was defined as a BHBA concentration of 1.2 to 2.9 mmol/L. Mixed-effects multivariable Poisson regression was used to assess DA, removal from herd, and conception to first service. Semiparametric proportional hazards models were used to evaluate days to conception, and repeated-measures ANOVA was used to evaluate milk yield in the first 30 DIM. A total of 741 of 1,717 (43.2%) eligible cows had a least one BHBA test of 1.2 to 2.9 mmol/L. Peak incidence of SCK occurred at 5 DIM, when 22.3% of cows had their first SCK-positive test.

Hyperketonemia was defined as a blood BHBA concentration of ≥1.2. mmol/L. Multivariable fixed-effects Poisson regression models were developed to predict the probability of a cow developing hyperketonemia between either 3 and 16 DIM or at her first BHBA test. As only the NY herds had precalving NEFA data, each prediction model was developed twice: once with data from all 4 herds (n=1,672) and once with data from only the NY herds (n=544).

  {"id":"mccabe2021","abstract":"Due to insufficient dry matter intake and heightened nutrient requirements in early lactation, periparturient dairy cows mobilize adipose and muscle tissues to bridge energy and amino acid gaps, respectively. Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between the relative muscle thickness of late pregnant cows and their early lactation performance. At 35 d before expected calving (BEC), longissimus dorsi muscle thickness (LDT) was measured in forty-one multiparous Holstein cows via ultrasound. Tissue mobilization was evaluated via ultrasound images of LDT and backfat thickness (BFT) at 21 and 7 d BEC as well as at 0, 10, 30, and 60 DIM. Plasma concentrations of 3-methylhistidine (3-MH), creatinine (CRE), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), and ?-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) were evaluated weekly. Milk yield and milk component data were collected through 60 DIM. Cattle were assigned post hoc to high-muscle (HM; n = 20; LDT > 4.49 cm) or low-muscle (LM; n = 21; ?4.37 cm) groups, with mean LDT at 35 d BEC greater in HM (5.05 ± 0.49) than in LM (3.52 ± 0.65) animals. Between 35 and 21 d BEC, LM cows gained LDT, whereas HM cows gained BFT.

Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between the relative muscle thickness of late pregnant cows and their early lactation performance. At 35 d before expected calving (BEC), longissimus dorsi muscle thickness (LDT) was measured in forty-one multiparous Holstein cows via ultrasound. Tissue mobilization was evaluated via ultrasound images of LDT and backfat thickness (BFT) at 21 and 7 d BEC as well as at 0, 10, 30, and 60 DIM. Plasma concentrations of 3-methylhistidine (3-MH), creatinine (CRE), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), and ?-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) were evaluated weekly. Milk yield and milk component data were collected through 60 DIM. Cattle were assigned post hoc to high-muscle (HM; n = 20; LDT > 4.49 cm) or low-muscle (LM; n = 21; ?4.37 cm) groups, with mean LDT at 35 d BEC greater in HM (5.05 ± 0.49) than in LM (3.52 ± 0.65) animals. Between 35 and 21 d BEC, LM cows gained LDT, whereas HM cows gained BFT.

They were randomly assigned to be individually fed from Day 0, for an average of 40 days, with 0.5 kg of a cereal-based supplementary feed that either contained 300 mg of OxBC (treatment; n=129 quarters) or did not (control; n=135 quarters). Quarter-milk samples were collected on Days 21 and 42 for microbiology and SCC assessment. Bacteriological cure was defined as having occurred when the bacteria present on Day 0 were not isolated from samples collected on Days 21 or 42. Clinical mastitis was diagnosed and recorded by herdowners up to Day 42.\nResults The bacteriological cure rate was greater for quarters from cows in the treatment group (13.9 (95% CI=4.1–23.7)%) than for quarters from cows in the control group (6.9 (95% CI=4.8–9.1)%; p=0.02). The prevalence of quarters that were infected on Day 42 was less in cows in the treatment group (79.9 (95% CI=62.3-97.6)%) than the control group (88.2 (95% CI=78.4-97.9)%; p=0.009). The incidence of quarters diagnosed with clinical mastitis by Day 42 was lower in cows from the treatment group (1/129 (0.78 (95% CI=0.02-4.24)%) than in cows from the control group (6/135 (4.44 (95% CI=1.65-9.42)%; p=0.03). Mean quarter-level SCC did not differ between treatment groups (p=0.34).\nConclusions and Clinical Relevance Feeding 300 mg/cow/day of fully oxidised β-carotene resulted in a higher bacteriological cure rate, a lower prevalence of intramammary infection following 6 weeks of feeding, and a lower incidence of clinical mastitis compared to untreated controls. This offers a non-antimicrobial approach to reducing prevalence of intramammary infection in dairy cows.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"McDougall","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"mcdougall2020","DOI":"10.1101/2020.10.12.335463","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,12]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2020, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

The onset of fermentation as evidenced by the accumulation of fermentation products and the decline in pH were slower (P < 0.05) in baled silage compared with silage made from precision-chopped herbage. Furthermore the pH (P < 0.001) and overall concentration of fermentation acids (P < 0.01) were lower while ammonia-N concentration was generally higher in baled silage, making it more conducive to the activities of Clostridia, Enterobacteria and yeast. Numbers of Enterobacteria were higher (P < 0.001) in baled silage in the early stages of ensilage and persisted in baled silage at the end of the storage period. The implications of a slower onset of fermentation in baled herbage are greater in farm practice, as the fermentation would be further restricted by a more extensive wilting of the herbage prior to ensiling.","author":[{"family":"McEniry","given":"J."},{"family":"O'Kiely","given":"P."},{"family":"Clipson","given":"N.

However, the application of the formic acid-based additive to the Harvest 1 and 2 timothy and Harvest 1 red clover herbages, where the silage fermentation characteristics were poorer, resulted in an increase in the proportion of lactic acid in total fermentation products and a decrease in pH.

  {"id":"mcfaddenSymposiumReviewOnecarbon2020","abstract":"The present review focuses on methyl donor metabolism and nutrition in the periparturient and lactating dairy cow. Methyl donors are involved in one-carbon metabolism, which includes the folate and Met cycles. These cycles work in unison to support lipid, nucleotide, and protein synthesis, as well as methylation reactions and the maintenance of redox status. A key feature of one-carbon metabolism is the multi-step conversion of tetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahyrofolate. Homocysteine and 5-methyltetrahyrofolate are utilized by vitamin B12-dependent Met synthase to couple the folate and Met cycles and generate Met. Methionine may also be remethylated from choline-derived betaine under the action of betaine hydroxymethyltransferase. Regardless, Met is converted within the Met cycle to S-adenosylmethionine, which is universally utilized in methyl-group transfer reactions including the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine. Homocysteine may also enter the transsulfuration pathway to generate glutathione or taurine for scavenging of reactive oxygen metabolites. In the transition cow, a high demand exists for compounds with a labile methyl group. Limited methyl group supply may contribute to inadequate hepatic phosphatidylcholine synthesis and hepatic triglyceride export, systemic oxidative stress, and compromised milk production. To minimize the perils associated with methyl donor deficiency, the peripartum cow relies on de novo methylneogenesis from tetrahydrofolate. In addition, dietary supplementation of rumen-protected folic acid, vitamin B12, Met, choline, and betaine are potential nutritional approaches to target one-carbon pools and improve methyl donor balance in transition cows. Such strategies have merit considering research demonstrating their ability to improve milk production efficiency, milk protein synthesis, hepatic health, and immune response. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of folic acid, vitamin B12, Met, choline, and betaine utilization in the dairy cow. Methyl donor co-supplementation, fatty acid feeding strategies that may optimize methyl donor supplementation efficacy, and potential epigenetic mechanisms are also considered.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"McFadden","given":"J W"},{"family":"Girard","given":"C L"},{"family":"Tao","given":"S"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Z"},{"family":"Bernard","given":"J K"},{"family":"Duplessis","given":"M"},{"family":"White","given":"H M"}],"citation-key":"mcfaddenSymposiumReviewOnecarbon2020","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2019-17319","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,8]]},"PMID":"32278559","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Symposium review: One-carbon metabolism and methyl donor nutrition in the dairy cow.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-17319","volume":"0"},

Digestibilities of N and starch in the small intestine were reduced for barley treated with NaOH, but values for rolled and roasted barley were similar. Apparent total tract digestibility of starch was reduced for the NaOH treated barley. Treatment of barley with NaOH tended to have a detrimental effect on feed intake, digestibility, and milk production. Roasting of barley did not appear to affect the site or extent of carbohydrate digestion, but roasting protected N from ruminal degradation.

  {"id":"meagher2019","abstract":"Separation of calves from cows within hours or days of birth is common on dairy farms. Stakeholders have conflicting perspectives on whether this practice is harmful or beneficial for the animals' welfare and production. Our objective was to critically evaluate the scientific evidence for both acute and long-term effects of early separation versus an extended period of cow–calf contact. The outcomes investigated were the behavior, welfare (excluding physical health), and performance (milk yield and growth, respectively) of dairy cows and calves. Primary research papers were found through targeted Web of Science searches, the reference lists of recent reviews for each topic, and the reference lists of papers identified from these sources. Studies were included if they were published in English, the full text was accessible, and they compared treatments with and without contact between dairy cows and calves for a specified period. Early separation (within 24 h postpartum) was found to reduce acute distress responses of cows and calves. However, longer cow–calf contact typically had positive longer-term effects on calves, promoting more normal social behavior, reducing abnormal behavior, and sometimes reducing responses to stressors. In terms of productivity, allowing cows to nurse calves generally decreased the volume of milk available for sale during the nursing period, but we found no consistent evidence of reduced milk production over a longer period. Allowing a prolonged period of nursing increased calf weight gains during the milk-feeding period. In summary, extended cow–calf contact aggravates the acute distress responses and reduces the amount of saleable milk while the calves are suckling, but it can have positive effects on behaviors relevant to welfare in the longer term and benefit calf growth. The strength of these conclusions is limited, however, given that relatively few studies address most of these effects and that experimental design including timing of contact and observations are often inconsistent across studies. Few studies presented indicators of long-term welfare effects other than abnormal and social behavior of the calves.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Meagher","given":"Rebecca K."},{"family":"Beaver","given":"Annabelle"},{"family":"Weary","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Keyserlingk","given":"Marina A.

  {"id":"megensComparisonLinkageDisequilibrium2009","abstract":"Background: The chicken (Gallus gallus), like most avian species, has a very distinct karyotype consisting of many micro- and a few macrochromosomes. While it is known that recombination frequencies are much higher for micro- as compared to macrochromosomes, there is limited information on differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype diversity between these two classes of chromosomes. In this study, LD and haplotype diversity were systematically characterized in 371 birds from eight chicken populations (commercial lines, fancy breeds, and red jungle fowl) across macro- and microchromosomes. To this end we sampled four regions of ~1 cM each on macrochromosomes (GGA1 and GGA2), and four 1.5 -2 cM regions on microchromosomes (GGA26 and GGA27) at a high density of 1 SNP every 2 kb (total of 889 SNPs).Results: At a similar physical distance, LD, haplotype homozygosity, haploblock structure, and haplotype sharing were all lower for the micro- as compared to the macrochromosomes. These differences were consistent across populations. Heterozygosity, genetic differentiation, and derived allele frequencies were also higher for the microchromosomes. Differences in LD, haplotype variation, and haplotype sharing between populations were largely in line with known demographic history of the commercial chicken. Despite very low levels of LD, as measured by r2 for most populations, some haploblock structure was observed, particularly in the macrochromosomes, but the haploblock sizes were typically less than 10 kb.Conclusion: Differences in LD between micro- and macrochromosomes were almost completely explained by differences in recombination rate. Differences in haplotype diversity and haplotype sharing between micro- and macrochromosomes were explained by differences in recombination rate and genotype variation. Haploblock structure was consistent with demography of the chicken populations, and differences in recombination rates between micro- and macrochromosomes. The limited haploblock structure and LD suggests that future whole-genome marker assays will need 100+K SNPs to exploit haplotype information. Interpretation and transferability of genetic parameters will need to take into account the size of chromosomes in chicken, and, since most birds have microchromosomes, in other avian species as well. ? 2009 Megens et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","author":[{"family":"Megens","given":"H.-J."},{"family":"Crooijmans","given":"R.P.M.A."},{"family":"Bastiaansen","given":"J.W.M."},{"family":"Kerstens","given":"H.H.D."},{"family":"Coster","given":"A."},{"family":"Jalving","given":"R."},{"family":"Vereijken","given":"A."},{"family":"Silva","given":"P."},{"family":"Muir","given":"W.M."},{"family":"Cheng","given":"H.H."},{"family":"Hanotte","given":"O."},{"family":"Groenen","given":"M.A.M."}],"citation-key":"megensComparisonLinkageDisequilibrium2009","container-title":"BMC Genetics","DOI":"10.1186/1471-2156-10-86","ISSN":"14712156","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"title":"Comparison of linkage disequilibrium and haplotype diversity on macro- and microchromosomes in chicken","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"Meier2014","abstract":"Previous research results have indicated an increase in pregnancy rate in pasture-grazed cows treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) 3 to 4 wk postcalving, when a high proportion of nucleated cells from within the uterus were polymorphonucleated; however, no effect on milk production was detected. It was hypothesized that this lack of effect on milk production was because the administration of the NSAID was too late after calving. The aims of the current study were to evaluate the timing of administering a propionic acid-derived NSAID (i.e., carprofen) on milk production, metabolic status, uterine health, and reproductive performance. Six-hundred and thirty-nine cows (134 primiparous and 505 multiparous) calving between July 4 and September 5, 2012, in 2 herds (herd 1: n=228; herd 2: n=411) were enrolled. Using a randomized block design, cows were allocated to 1 of 3 treatment groups as they calved: (1) no treatment (control; n=221), (2) NSAID administered on d 1, 3, and 5 postcalving (early; n=214), and (3) NSAID administered on d 19, 21, and 23 postcalving (late; n=204). Milk production and composition, and body condition were determined weekly. Blood was sampled at 4 time points (1 precalving and 3 postcalving) to determine the effects of treatment on indicators of metabolic health and energy status. Uterine health was determined by measuring the proportion of nucleated cells that were polymorphonucleated following cytobrush sampling of the uterus between d 13 to 24 and d 30 to 49 postcalving. Irrespective of timing of application, NSAID did not affect milk production, body weight, or body condition during early lactation. Treatment with an NSAID 19 to 23 d postcalving increased the proportion of cows submitted for breeding during the first 3 wk of the seasonal breeding program (control: 85%, early: 83%, and late: 92%), but did not affect conception or pregnancy rates. No detectable effect of treatment on uterine health or circulating metabolites and minerals existed, although cows in the early NSAID treatment group had marginally lower serum β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations (0.1 mmol/L) than the other groups between 2 and 26 d in milk. In conclusion, administration of this particular NSAID at either 1 or 3 wk after calving did not improve milk production, indicators of health, or reproductive performance.","author":[{"family":"Meier","given":"S."},{"family":"Priest","given":"N.

  {"id":"Melendez2006","abstract":"The objective of this study was to determine risk factors for udder edema (case-control study) and to evaluate the association of udder edema in primiparous Holstein cows with their lactation performance (cohort study). Values for the first 10 test day for milk yield, fat, protein, and somatic cell counts (SCC) linear score as well as mature equivalent (ME) 305 days milk yield, fat, protein, SCC linear score, and incidences of periparturient diseases from a computerized farm recording system were compared between primiparous cows with and without udder edema. Data consisted of 118 dairy heifers with udder edema, induced for parturition, and treated with diuretics and 889 control heifers that received no treatment. Primiparous cows giving birth to male calves, were 1.72 (1.01, 3.24; 95% CI) times more likely to develop udder edema than cows giving birth to female calves. Primiparous cows calving in winter season were 3.68 (1.09, 12.5; 95% CI) times more likely to develop udder edema than cows calving in summer. For each extra 10cm in height the odds of udder edemas was 1.23 (1.03, 1.47; 95% CI). The first test day DHIA milk yield was lower in cows that developed udder edema (3.6kg/day) than in normal cows. However, the subsequent test days and ME measurements were not statistically different between groups. Cows with udder edema were 1.62 (1.18, 2.14; 95% CI) times more likely to develop udder edema in the second lactation than control animals. It is concluded that the gender of the offspring, calving season and height at parturition were significant risk factors for udder edema. Only milk yield on the first DHIA test day was lower in cows with udder edema than in cows without udder edema.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Melendez","given":"P"},{"family":"Hofer","given":"C C"},{"family":"Donovan","given":"G","dropping-particle":"a"}],"citation-key":"Melendez2006","container-title":"Preventive veterinary medicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.prevetmed.2006.05.004","ISSN":"0167-5877","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",10,17]]},"page":"211-21","PMID":"16774793","title":"Risk factors for udder edema and its association with lactation performance on primiparous Holstein cows in a large Florida herd, U.S.A.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16774793","volume":"76"},

Forage (<i>Lolium multiflorum</i>) was cut daily and offered ad libitum beginning at 0800h in individual stalls, and a TMR was offered ad libitum during the period when cows had no access to FF. Fresh forage dry matter intake (DMI) increased and TMR DMI decreased with the access time to FF, whereas total DMI was 3.0kg higher for T4 than for T8; no differences were detected with T0. Compared with T0, 8h/d of access to FF decreased milk, protein, and casein yields, and tended to decrease fat and lactose yields, but treatment had no effect on milk composition or feed efficiency. The milk fatty acid profile in T8 had a higher content of rumenic, vaccenic, and linolenic acids compared with T0.

  {"id":"Menegazzi2021","abstract":"Sward height is strongly related to the daily dry matter intake of grazing dairy cows, which consequently determines animal performance. Despite that, few studies have explored the potential to increase milk production by managing post-grazing sward height. An experiment was carried out to evaluate the effect of three defoliation intensities on a Lolium arundinaceum -based pasture on frequency and length of grazing meals and ruminating bouts, daily grazing and ruminating time, feeding stations and patches exploration, and dry matter intake and milk production of dairy cows. The treatments imposed were three different post-grazing sward heights: control (TC), medium (TM), and lax (TL), which were managed with 6, 9, and 12 cm of post-grazing sward heights during autumn and winter, and 9, 12, and 15 cm of post-grazing sward heights during spring, respectively. Thirty-six autumn-calving Holstein cows were grouped by parity (2.6 ± 0.8), body weight (618 ± 48) kg, and body condition score (2.8 ± 0.2) and randomized to the treatments. The pasture was accessed from 08:00 to 14:00 and 17:00 to 03:00 during spring and no supplement was involved during the evaluation period. Daily grazing time averaged 508 ± 15 min and was not affected by treatment. The reduction of post-grazing sward height increased the length of the first grazing session in the morning and the afternoon. The number of grazing sessions was greater on TL than on TM, with no difference in TC. The number of feeding stations (the hypothetical semi-circle in front of an animal from which the bites were taken without moving the front forefeet) visited was less on TC than on TL, and neither of them differed from TM. Dry matter (DM) intake was lesser on TC than on TM and TL (14.7 vs. 17.8 kg DM). Milk production during the evaluation period was 13.1, 16.2, and 18.7 kg/day for TC, TM, and TL, respectively. The milk fat, protein, and lactose content did not differ between treatments. The cows on TC exhibited a lower intake rate, although they were less selective, probably as a consequence of the sward structure of TC treatment. The cows on TM adopted a compensation mechanism which allowed them to achieve the same dry matter intake as cows on TL, but lower milk production. The cows on TL were more selective than TC and TM resulting in higher digestible dry matter intake and consequently higher milk production. The intensity of defoliation impacts on the animal-plant interaction, and constitutes a valuable management tool that can be used to boost forage intake and milk production. The new developments on information technology would allow researchers to link behavioral data with response variables (e.g., milk production, health, welfare, etc.) at different spatio-temporal scales and support short and long-term management decisions.","author":[{"family":"Menegazzi","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Giles","given":"Pamela Yanina"},{"family":"Oborsky","given":"Matías"},{"family":"Fast","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Mattiauda","given":"Diego Antonio"},{"family":"Genro","given":"Teresa Cristina Moraes"},{"family":"Chilibroste","given":"Pablo"}],"citation-key":"Menegazzi2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Animal Science","DOI":"10.3389/fanim.2021.742685","issue":"November","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"1-12","title":"Effect of Post-grazing Sward Height on Ingestive Behavior, Dry Matter Intake, and Milk Production of Holstein Dairy Cows","type":"article-journal","volume":"2"},

Feeding and housing practices for dairy calves impact performance and growth early in life, as well as feeding behaviour. There is also increasing evidence that early exposure to different feeding and housing strategies influence the development of feeding behaviour. The dairy calf needs access to milk in sufficient quantities to maintain health and high-levels of growth. In addition, intake of solid feed, such as grain concentrate, is necessary early in life to establish fermentation and develop the rumen. In dairy calves, feeding behaviour patterns can have direct impact on nutrient consumption and, consequently, growth. Further, recent research has provided evidence that behaviour patterns that develop in response to management factors early in life may persist once learned, potentially having longer-term implications for health and welfare. Thus, there is potential for various nutritional, housing, and management factors to impact the learning of feeding behaviour early in the life of dairy calves. This review provides several examples of early management factors that influence feeding behaviour of dairy calves and, in turn, impact calf growth and welfare. For example, providing continuous, ad libitum access to milk results not only in greater growth, but also in meal patterns that more closely resemble the natural behaviour of a calf suckling its dam. Housing management also has the potential to influence when, and how much, a calf eats. Whereas social facilitation promotes intake, particularly at weaning, competition for feed in group-housed calves restricts feeding patterns and degree of feeding synchrony. With regards to provision of solid feed, recent data suggest that providing physically effective hay, in addition to grain concentrate, may be beneficial for the rumen environment and consequent growth and efficiency. However, the physical form and presentation of forage may also influence feeding behaviour of calves, in particular feed sorting, which can impact both immediate nutrient intakes as well as the development and persistence of that behaviour. For example, calves provided hay and concentrate as a mixture begin to sort their feed early in life, with the pattern of sorting depending on hay particle size. Feed sorting in young calves may reflect a motivation to consume a proportion of hay in the diet. In general, it appears to be beneficial for early growth and welfare to support milk and solid feed intake through unrestricted allowances and less-competitive feeding environments. Continued research in this area is needed to assess the longevity of learned behaviour patterns, and what factors may influence their persistence.","author":[{"family":"Miller-Cushon","given":"E.

The objectives of this study were to assess the effects of feed push-up frequency on the behavioral patterns of dairy cows, and to determine associations between behavior and milk yield and composition. Lactating Holstein dairy cows (n = 28, parity = 1.9 ± 1.1; mean ± SD) were housed in tiestalls, milked twice per day, and offered ad libitum access to water and a total mixed ration (containing, on a dry matter basis: 25% corn silage, 25% grass/alfalfa haylage, 30% high-moisture corn, and 20% protein/mineral supplement), provided twice per day. Cows were divided into 2 groups of 14 (balanced by days in milk, milk production, and parity) and individually exposed to each of 2 treatments in a crossover design with 21-d periods; treatment 1 had infrequent feed push-up (3×/d), whereas treatment 2 had frequent feed push-up (5×/d). During the last 7 d of each period, dry matter intake and milk production were recorded and lying behavior was monitored using electronic data loggers. During the last 2 d of each period, milk samples were collected for analysis of protein and fat content and feed samples of fresh feed and orts were collected for particle size analysis. The particle size separator had 3 screens (19, 8, and 1.18 mm) and a bottom pan, resulting in 4 fractions (long, medium, short, fine). Sorting was calculated as the actual intake of each particle size fraction expressed as a percentage of the predicted intake of that fraction. Feed push-up frequency had no effect on lying time [11.4 ± 0.37 h/d; mean ± standard error (SE)], milk production (40.2 ± 1.28 kg/d) and composition (milk protein: 3.30 ± 0.048%; milk fat: 3.81 ± 0.077%), or feed sorting. Cows sorted against long particles (78.0 ± 2.2%) and for short (102.6 ± 0.6%) and fine (108.4 ± 0.9%) particles. Milk fat content decreased by 0.1 percentage points for every 10% increase in sorting against long particles and was not associated with lying behavior or other cow-level factors. Milk protein content decreased by 0.03 percentage points for every hour decrease in lying time and by 0.04 percentage points for every 10% increase in sorting against long particles. These results suggest that sorting against long ration particles may negatively affect milk composition. Additionally, we did not find that altering feed push-up frequency affected feed sorting or cow standing and lying patterns.","author":[{"family":"Miller-Cushon","given":"E.K."},{"family":"DeVries","given":"T.J."}],"citation-key":"Miller-Cushon2017","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2016-12004","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"2213-2218","PMID":"28088413","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Short communication: Associations between feed push-up frequency, feeding and lying behavior, and milk yield and composition of dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030217300334","volume":"100"},

PA did not affect DMI compared with CON (28.5 vs. 29.2 kg/d; P = 0.13), milk yield (47.0 vs. 47.4 kg/d; P = 0.67), milk protein yield (1.42 vs. 1.45 kg/d; P = 0.15), milk lactose yield (2.29 vs. 2.31 kg/d; P = 0.46), yield of de novo milk FA (360 vs. 370 g/d; P = 0.23), yield of preformed milk FA (642 vs. 630 g/d; P = 0.56), BW (720 vs. 723 kg; P = 0.80), or BCS (3.14 vs. 3.23; P = 0.17). PA-FA increased DMI compared to PA-TG (29.1 vs. 27.8 kg/d; P = 0.05), yield of 16-carbon milk FA (596 vs. 545 g/d; P < 0.01), and tended to increase milk yield (47.6 vs. 46.4 kg/d; P = 0.06), milk fat yield (1.71 vs. 1.66 kg/d; P = 0.10), and 3.5% FCM (48.1 vs. 47.2 kg/d; P = 0.09). In conclusion, the production response of dairy cows to PA tended to be greater for a FA than a TG supplement. Overall, PA increased milk fat yield, 3.5% FCM and feed efficiency in mid-lactation dairy cows.","author":[{"family":"Millet","given":"Sam"}],"citation-key":"Millet2014","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"title":"Voederwaarde van DDGS en enkele andere bijproducten van de bio-ethanolwinning varkens en pluimvee Voederwaarde van DDGS en enkele andere bijproducten van de bio-ethanolwinning uit granen voor rundvee , varkens en pluimvee","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"Minuti2014","abstract":"Acute acidosis was induced in sheep, and gastrointestinal permeability was assessed by using lactulose as a permeability marker. Metabolism was evaluated by monitoring blood metabolites. Four rams (72.5 ± 4.6 kg BW) were used in a 2 × 2 changeover design experiment. The experimental period lasted 96 h from -24 to 72 h. After 24 h of fasting (from -24 to 0 h) for both controls and acidosis-induced rams (ACID), 0.5 kg of wheat flour was orally dosed at 0 and 12 h of the experimental period to ACID, while the basal diet (grass hay, ad libitum) was restored to control. At 24 h, a lactulose solution (30 g of lactulose in 200 mL of water) was orally administered. Blood samples were collected at -24, 0, 24, 48, and 72 h of the experimental periods for the analysis of metabolic profiles and during the 10 h after lactulose dosage to monitor lactulose changes in blood. In addition, rumen and fecal samples were collected at 24 h of the experimental period. The acidotic challenge markedly reduced (P < 0.01) rumen pH and VFA but increased rumen d- and l-lactic acid (P < 0.01). Concurrently, a decrease of fecal pH and VFA occurred in ACID (P < 0.01), together with an abrupt increase (P < 0.01) of lactate and fecal alkaline phosphatase. Blood lactulose was significantly increased in ACID peaking 2 h after lactulose dosage. Blood glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate, Ca, K, Mg, and alkaline phosphatase showed a significant reduction (P < 0.05) at 24 h, whereas urea and NEFA declined (P < 0.05) from 48 to 72 h. A strong inflammatory acute phase response with oxidative stress in ACID group was observed from 24 to 72 h; higher values of haptoglobin (P < 0.01) were measured from 24 to 72 h and of ceruloplasmin from 48 (P < 0.05) to 72 h (P < 0.01). Among the negative acute phase reactants, plasma albumin, cholesterol, paraoxonase, and Zn concentration also decreased (P < 0.05) in ACID at different time points between 24 and 72 h after acidotic challenge start. A rise (P < 0.05) of reactive oxygen metabolites and a drop of vitamin E (P < 0.01) between 24 and 72 h were indicative of oxidative stress in ACID. The perturbation of these blood metabolites suggests that acute acidosis was effectively induced by our model. The increase of lactulose in blood in ACID indicates that gastrointestinal permeability for the marker increased and the large increment after 2 h from dosage suggests that most of the passage occurred through the rumen or abomasal walls.","author":[{"family":"Minuti","given":"A."},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"S."},{"family":"Trevisi","given":"E."},{"family":"Piccioli-Cappelli","given":"F."},{"family":"Bertoni","given":"G."},{"family":"Jahan","given":"N."},{"family":"Bani","given":"P."},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"Minuti2014","container-title":"Journal of Animal Science","DOI":"10.2527/jas.2014-7594","ISSN":"15253163","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"3966-3977","PMID":"24987080","title":"Experimental acute rumen acidosis in sheep: Consequences on clinical, rumen, and gastrointestinal permeability conditions and blood chemistry","type":"article-journal","volume":"92"},

  {"id":"Mir2004a","abstract":"Canadian beef consumption is approximately 31 kg per annum, or a third of all meats consumed. Beef is a nutrient-rich food, providing good quality protein, vitamins B-6 and B-12, niacin, iron, and zinc. However, animal fats have gained the reputation of being less healthy. The identification of the anticarcinogenic effects of beef extracts due to the presence of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has heightened interest in increasing the amount of CLA deposited in beef. Beef cattle produce CLA and deposit these compounds in the meat; thus, beef consumers can receive bioformed CLA. Beef contains both of the bioactive CLA isomers, namely, cis-9, trans-11 and trans-10, cis-12. The relative content of these CLA isomers in beef depends on the feeds consumed by the animals during production. Feeding cattle linoleic acid-rich oils for extended periods of time increases the CLA content of beef. Depending on the type and relative maturity of the pasture, beef from pasture-fed cattle may have a higher CLA content than beef from grain- or silage-fed cattle. In feedlot animals fed high-grain diets, inclusion of dietary oil along with hay during both the growth and finishing phases led to an increase in CLA content from 2.8 to 14 mg/g beef fat, which would provide 77 mg CLA in an 85-g serving of beef. The CLAs appear to be concentrated in intramuscular and subcutaneous fat of beef cattle, with the CLA trans-10, cis-12 isomer being greater in the subcutaneous fat.","author":[{"family":"Mir","given":"Priya S"},{"family":"McAllister","given":"Timothy","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Scott","given":"Shannon"},{"family":"Aalhus","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Baron","given":"Vern"},{"family":"McCartney","given":"Duane"},{"family":"Charmley","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Goonewardene","given":"Laki"},{"family":"Basarab","given":"John"},{"family":"Okine","given":"Erasmus"},{"family":"Weselake","given":"Randall J"},{"family":"Mir","given":"Zahir"}],"citation-key":"Mir2004a","container-title":"The American journal of clinical nutrition","ISSN":"0002-9165","issue":"6 Suppl","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",6]]},"page":"1207S-1211S","PMID":"15159258","title":"Conjugated linoleic acid-enriched beef production.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15159258","volume":"79"},
  {"id":"mitchell2023","abstract":"Some cellulolytic bacteria require 1 or more branched-chain volatile fatty acids (BCVFA) for the synthesis of branched-chain AA and branched-chain long-chain fatty acids because they are not able to uptake branched-chain AA or lack 1 or more enzymes to synthesize branched-chain AA de novo. Supplemental BCVFA and valerate were included previously as a feed additive that was later removed from the market; these older studies and more current studies have noted improvements in neutral detergent fiber digestibility and milk efficiency. However, most studies provided a single BCVFA or else isobutyrate (IB), 2-methylbutyrate (MB), isovalerate, and valerate altogether without exploring optimal combinations. Our objective was to determine a combination of isoacids that is optimal for milk production. Sixty (28 primiparous and 32 multiparous) lactating Jersey cows (106 ± 54 days in milk) were blocked and assigned randomly to either a control (CON) treatment without any isoacids, MB [12.3 mmol/kg dry matter (DM)], MB + IB (7.7 and 12.6 mmol/kg DM of MB and IB, respectively), or all 4 isoacids (6.2, 7.3, 4.2, and 5.1 mmol/kg DM of MB, IB, isovalerate, and valerate, respectively). Cattle were fed the CON treatment for a 2-wk period, then were assigned randomly within a block to treatments for 8 wk (n = 15). There was a trend for an interaction of supplement and parity for milk components. There were no differences in components for primiparous cows, whereas MB + IB tended to increase protein concentration by 0.04 and 0.08 percentage units in multiparous cows compared with the CON and MB treatments, respectively. Feeding MB + IB increased fat concentration by 0.23 to 0.31 percentage units compared with all other treatments in multiparous cows. Milk yield and dry matter intake (DMI) did not change with treatment. Treatment interacted with week for milk net energy for lactation/DMI; MB + IB tended to increase milk net energy of lactation/DMI by 0.10 Mcal/kg compared with MB and approached a trend for CON, mainly during the early weeks of the treatment period, whereas differences decreased during the last 2 wk of the treatment period. Cows fed MB had the highest 15:0 anteiso fatty acids in the total milk fatty acid profile, which was greater than that for CON or MB + IB cows, but not cows supplemented with isoacids. Cows fed MB alone had the numerically lowest milk net energy for lactation/DMI. The combination of MB + IB appeared optimal for increasing feed efficiency in our study and was not at the expense of average daily gain. Further research is needed for evaluating how potential changes in supplemental isoacid dosage should vary under differing dietary conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Mitchell","given":"K.

  {"id":"Moallem2010","abstract":"Our objectives were to determine the effects of rapid growth rate during the preweaning period and prepubertal protein supplementation on long-term growth pattern and milk production during the first lactation. Forty-six Israeli Holstein heifer calves were fed either milk replacer (MR) or whole milk (WM) from 4 to 60 d age. Calves had free access to WM or MR for 30 min twice daily and free-choice water and starter mix for the entire day. From weaning until 150 d of age, all heifers were fed the same ration. At 150 d of age the heifers were divided into 2 subgroups, with one subgroup supplemented with an additional 2% protein until 320 d of age. Thereafter, all heifers were housed and fed together until calving. Another cluster of 20 heifers was raised on MR and WM treatments and 3 animals from each nursery treatment were slaughtered at 60 d and 10 mo age to determine effects of nursery treatment on organ and adipose tissue mass. Prior to weaning, the MR heifers consumed 0.12 kg/d more DM than the WM heifers, but metabolizable energy intake was not different. Body weight at weaning and average daily gain during the preweaning period were 3.1 kg and 0.074 kg/d higher, respectively, in the WM treatment than in the MR treatment, with no differences in other measurements. Nursery feeding treatment and added protein had no effect on growth rate in the prepubertal period, but the postweaning difference in BW between the WM and MR heifers remained throughout the entire rearing period. The age at first insemination was 23 d earlier and age at pregnancy and first calving was numerically lower for the WM heifers than for the MR heifers. Adipose tissue weights at weaning were doubled in the WM calves. First-lactation milk production and 4% fat-corrected milk were 10.3 and 7.1% higher, respectively, for WM heifers than for MR heifers, whereas prepubertal added protein tended to increase milk yield. In conclusion, preweaning WM at high feeding rates appears to have long-term effects that are beneficial to future milk production. The positive long-term effects of feeding WM on first-lactation milk production were independent of their effects on skeletal growth. Enhanced milk production observed with WM treatment may be related to the milk supply, paracrine or endocrine effects of fat tissues on mammary parenchyma, or a combination of both factors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Moallem","given":"U"},{"family":"Werner","given":"D"},{"family":"Lehrer","given":"H"},{"family":"Zachut","given":"M"},{"family":"Livshitz","given":"L"},{"family":"Yakoby","given":"S"},{"family":"Shamay","given":"a"}],"citation-key":"Moallem2010","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2009-3007","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",6]]},"page":"2639-50","PMID":"20494173","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Long-term effects of ad libitum whole milk prior to weaning and prepubertal protein supplementation on skeletal growth rate and first-lactation milk production.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20494173","volume":"93"},

  {"id":"Moe1981","abstract":"Energy metabolism research during the past 25 yr has resolved many uncertainties of energy use by lactating cows. Use of metabolizable energy for milk production essentially is unaffected by milk yield but is slightly influenced by its source. Estimates of efficiency of use for milk production (60 to 64%) are lower than earlier estimates (69 to 70%) primarily because of lower maintenance costs. Efficiency of metabolizable energy for body gain is higher in lactating (75%) than nonlactating (60%) cows. Use of body tissue energy for milk production is about 82% efficient. End products of digestion contribute to variation in efficiency of fattening and in partition of energy between milk and body gain in the lactating animal. Energy use in the growing animal is influenced by composition of tissue gained and composition of the diet. Energetic efficiency of protein deposition is apparently much lower than that of fat deposition. A substantial part of the lower efficiency of protein deposition is related to energy costs of protein turnover. Incomplete digestion of mixed diets at high intake by lactating cows and methods to predict energy partition are serious practical problems. In the short term, improved methods to predict intake effects on metabolizable energy of mixed diets will increase accuracy of diet formulations. In the longer term, methods to predict quantities of nutrients absorbed from the gut will permit a more flexible and accurate method of evaluating diets and predicting animal performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Moe","given":"P W"}],"citation-key":"Moe1981","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(81)82692-6","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1981",6]]},"page":"1120-39","PMID":"7024342","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Energy metabolism of dairy cattle.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7024342","volume":"64"},

Initially, cows were grouped according to the source of prepartum fat (either CaSO or CaLN, with 12 cows in each group). Postpartum, these groups were further subdivided according to whether the fat source was administered continuously (LN-LN, SO-SO) or alternately (LN-SO, SO-LN) over a 28-day period. This resulted in four different treatment groups, each with six cows. The fat supplements contained 84% fat and 9% Ca. No statistically significant differences were found in dry matter intake (DMI), colostrum yield or most concentrations of blood metabolites (insulin, cholesterol, glucose, triglycerides, total protein, albumin, β-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and urea-N). However, cows fed CaSO prepartum had a significantly higher plasma concentration of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) than cows fed CaLN. Cows fed CaSO had higher backfat thickness (BFT) from day -21 to 0 than those fed CaLN (P = 0.05). Notably, cows in the SO-SO group lost the most weight, while cows in the SO-LN group lost the least, especially on days 21 and 28 postpartum (P = 0.05). Switching from soybean oil prepartum to linseed oil postpartum (SO-LN) significantly increased milk production in the first 28 days of lactation compared to other diets. In addition, the fat content in milk was influenced by the type of fat supplementation prepartum, with cows receiving CaSO having a lower milk fat percentage than those receiving CaLN (P < 0.05). The results on blood parameters suggest potential benefits of the SO-LN diet for postpartum cows, as emphasized by stable BHB concentrations and the highest IGF-1 concentrations, especially without the elevated BHB concentrations typically associated with the SO-SO diet. The blood concentrations of total protein, urea-N, triglycerides and NEFA were not affected by the treatments. Also, the dietary change did not adversely affect liver function, as shown by unchanged AST and ALT concentrations. Therefore, the results suggest that a dietary intervention involving the administration of soybean oil prepartum and switching to linseed oil postpartum (SO-LN strategy) has the potential to improve milk yield during the early lactation period.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Montazeri","given":"Esmaeil"},{"family":"Riasi","given":"Ahmad"},{"family":"Ghorbani","given":"Gholam Reza"},{"family":"Mahyari","given":"Saeid Ansari"},{"family":"Jamali","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Ghaffari","given":"Morteza Hosseini"}],"citation-key":"montazeri2024","container-title":"Animal Feed Science and Technology","container-title-short":"Animal Feed Science and Technology","DOI":"10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2024.116133","ISSN":"0377-8401","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,16]]},"page":"116133","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Effects of pre- and postpartum dietary fat sources (soybean oil versus linseed oil) on lactation performance and blood metabolites in transition dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037784012400261X"},
  {"id":"Monteiro2016","abstract":"Preliminary studies suggest that maternal heat stress (HS) during late gestation exerts carryover effects on a calf's insulin response after weaning, but a comprehensive evaluation of how maternal HS affects calf intake, growth, and metabolic response from birth to weaning is lacking. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of maternal HS during the dry period on dry matter intake, growth, and metabolism from birth to weaning. After birth, 20 heifers born to either HS (n = 10) or cooled (CL, n = 10) dry cows were immediately separated from their dams and fed 3.8 L of colostrum from a common pool within 4 h of birth. All heifers were managed identically and weaned at 49 d of age (DOA). Calf starter intake was recorded daily, and body weight was assessed at birth and every 2 wk from birth to 56 DOA. Blood samples were collected twice a week until 56 DOA to assess hematocrit and concentrations of insulin and metabolites. To evaluate metabolic responses to maternal HS, a glucose tolerance test, insulin, and epinephrine challenge were performed on 3 consecutive days for all heifers at 8, 29, and 57 DOA. Maternal HS during the dry period did not affect heifer birth weight. Compared with HS, CL calves consumed more starter (0.53 vs. 0.34 kg/d) from birth to 56 DOA and were heavier (71.7 vs. 61.4 kg) at 56 DOA. Relative to HS calves, CL calves tended to have higher hematocrit (27.4 vs. 24.7%). No differences were found between treatments in plasma concentrations of insulin and glucose, but HS calves had higher nonesterified fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations after 32 DOA. Compared with CL, HS calves had a faster glucose clearance after a glucose tolerance test and a slower insulin clearance after an insulin challenge. In conclusion, maternal HS during late gestation reduces calf starter intake and growth, alters blood metabolite profile, and increases noninsulin-dependent glucose uptake.","author":[{"family":"Monteiro","given":"A.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of 2 different physical forms of forage on performance, apparent digestibility, and feeding behavior of young calves. Twenty Holstein male calves (46.8±1.2kg) were randomly assigned at birth to 1 of 2 feeding treatments in which they were exposed to a mixed ration containing (on a DM basis) 90% crumb starter concentrate and either (1) 10% coarsely chopped (3 to 4cm) grass hay (CRS; n=10) or (2) 10% finely ground (2mm) grass hay (FN; n=10). All calves were offered 8L/d of milk replacer (MR; 1.2kg of DM) from birth; the amount of MR was progressively reduced after 5wk to enable weaning by the end of wk 7. The study finished after wk 8. Consumption of the mixed ration, MR, and water was recorded daily, and calves were weighed twice weekly. Samples of feed and orts were taken in wk 7 and 8 for nutrient content analysis. Behavioral data for each calf were obtained for 2h/d during wk 6 and 8, for a total observation time per animal of 28h. Total feces were collected during wk 8 to determine apparent digestibility. Calves fed CRS had greater DM intake than those fed FN (2.70 vs. 2.45±0.11kg/d, respectively) during the week after weaning (wk 8). Body weight gain was similar between treatments; however, calves fed CRS tended to have a greater gain-to-feed ratio than calves fed FN (0.68 vs. 0.63±0.02kg of gain/kg of DM intake). No differences were observed in crude protein and acid detergent fiber consumption between treatments; however, calves fed CRS tended to consume more neutral detergent fiber than calves fed FN during the last week of the study (719.2 vs. 610.5±25.84g/d). Calves receiving CRS sorted in favor of neutral detergent fiber to a greater extent than calves consuming FN, whereas calves fed FN sorted in favor of crude protein to a greater extent than calves fed CRS. Apparent DM, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber digestibility values were greater in calves fed CRS than in those fed FN (72.3, 77.4, 40.7, and 42.7% vs. 69.2, 74.5, 34.0, and 35.6%, respectively). Calves fed FN spent more time performing nonnutritive oral behaviors than those fed CRS, and calves fed FN tended to spend less time idle (either lying or standing) than those fed CRS. In conclusion, providing chopped hay to young calves improved feed intake, DM, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber digestibility values during the week after weaning, and reduced nonnutritive oral behaviors compared with offering ground hay.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Montoro","given":"C"},{"family":"Miller-Cushon","given":"E K"},{"family":"Devries","given":"T J"},{"family":"Bach","given":"a"}],"citation-key":"Montoro2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5731","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",2]]},"page":"1117-24","PMID":"23219116","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of physical form of forage on performance, feeding behavior, and digestibility of Holstein calves.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23219116","volume":"96"},

Chewing activity was recorded every 5 min for the last 24 h of each period. Dry matter intake was not affected by treatment (mean = 27.9 kg/d). Bicarbonate treatments increased yields of milk, milk fat, and fat- and solids-corrected milk compared with chloride treatments, but cation treatments did not affect any measured variable. The 4 ion treatments reduced ruminating time per day when compared with control by decreasing the length of rumination bouts.

In 6 commercial AMS dairy herds, 390 dairy cows were randomly assigned before calving to 1 of 2 treatments, within farm, balanced by parity: (1) control group (CON) receiving a standard AMS pellet [mean = 3.9 kg/d on a dry matter (DM) basis, n=188], or (2) same amount of standard AMS pellet (mean = 3.6 kg/d on a DM basis, n=202) plus 1 kg/d DM of LF for multiparous cows (1.6 kg/d as fed) and 0.88 kg/d DM for primiparous cows (1.4 kg/d as fed). Across farms, cows were fed partial mixed rations similar in ingredient and nutrient composition. Cows on the LF treatment received supplementation for the first 60 d in milk (DIM). Blood samples were taken 2 times/wk for the first 3 wk postcalving to assess β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Samples with BHB ≥1.2 mmol/L were classified as a positive case of subclinical ketosis (SCK). Cow body condition and lameness were scored every 10 d postcalving until 60 DIM. No differences were detected between treatments for milk yield (average milk yield=37.4 ± 1.98 kg/d) and milking frequency (average milking frequency=3.2 ± 0.01 times/d). Similarly, no difference between treatments in daily AMS visits was detected (average AMS visits=5.3 ± 0.3 times/d). However, CON cows experienced more AMS refusals/d than LF cows (LF = 1.6 refusals/d, CON=2.1 refusals/d). No difference between treatments in daily rumination time was detected (average rumination time=476 ± 10.8 min/d). Treatment was associated with the number of times cows tested positive for SCK; cows on LF had fewer repeated diagnoses of SCK, such that 15% of cows on LF had ≥3 diagnoses of SCK out of 5 tests, compared with 27% of CON cows. Cows receiving molasses tended to have lower blood BHB values at ∼15 DIM. Molasses supplementation also allowed cows to maintain a more stable body condition score, as LF cows tended to lose less body condition over the first 60 DIM compared with CON cows. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that supplementing a molasses-based LF to AMS cows may help support the energy demands of milk production in early lactation and, thus, reduce the incidence of repeat positive SCK tests during that time period.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Moore","given":"S.

Beginning 21 d before expected calving, primiparous (n = 9) and multiparous (n = 13) cows (body condition score of 3.63 ± 0.08) were sequentially assigned within parity to EN (12. g provided with ration twice daily) or control through 21 d postpartum.

On d 7 postpartum, a caffeine clearance test was performed to assess liver function, and on d 21 to 23 postpartum, blood samples were collected every 8. h to monitor posttreatment nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) responses. Data were analyzed using mixed models with repeated measures over time. A treatment × time × parity effect was observed on prepartum dry matter intake (DMI), which was caused by a 4. kg/d decrease in DMI of EN-treated multiparous cows compared with control multiparous cows during the final 4 d prepartum. A significant increase in plasma nicotinamide concentration occurred in EN-treated cows on d -7 and 21 relative to parturition. Prepartum glucose concentration decreased in treated animals, with no difference in plasma insulin concentration. Treatment × time × parity effects were detected for NEFA and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations during the postpartum period.

After treatments ended on d 21, no evidence was found for a plasma NEFA rebound in either parity group. A treatment × parity × time interaction was detected for liver triglyceride content, indicating a tendency for less liver triglyceride in EN-treated primiparous cows, but caffeine clearance rates were not affected by treatment.

  {"id":"Morin2018","abstract":"Limiting milk production for a short period of time in early lactation could be a relevant strategy to prevent hyperketonemia (HYK). From December 2013 to March 2015, 838 multiparous Holstein cows from 13 herds were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of incomplete milking in early lactation on ketonemia and its effect on body condition score (BCS) loss. Cows were randomly assigned 4 wk before expected calving date to 1 of 2 treatment groups, (1) a conventional milking protocol (CON) for which cows were completely milked or (2) an incomplete milking protocol (INC) for which a maximum of 10 to 14 kg of milk/d were withdrawn during the first 5 d in milk (DIM). β-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations were measured from blood samples collected on each cow 3 times at weekly intervals. Hyperketonemia was defined as BHB ≥1.4 mmol/L. Body condition score variation in the postcalving period was calculated by subtracting BCS assessed at wk 7 from BCS assessed at first week after calving. Effect of treatment on ketonemia and prevalence of HYK were evaluated for 4 specific time periods: 1 to 3, 4 to 7, 8 to 17, and 18 to 26 DIM. Effect of treatment on ketonemia was investigated using linear mixed models with natural logarithm of BHB measurements as outcome and treatment groups as fixed effect. Generalized linear mixed models with HYK as outcome, using logit link, and treatment groups as fixed effect were used to investigate effect of treatment on odds of HYK. A logistic regression model with BCS loss (<0.75 or ≥0.75) as outcome and treatment groups and herd as fixed effects was used to study effect of INC on odds of having BCS loss ≥0.75. A total of 813 lactations had complete data and were used for statistical analysis of ketonemia and HYK. A total of 709 lactations had complete data and were used for analysis of BCS loss. Geometric means of blood BHB concentrations during the 1 to 3, 4 to 7, 8 to 17, and 18 to 26 DIM periods were, respectively, 0.72 (95% confidence interval = 0.66, 0.80), 0.66 (0.60, 0.73), 0.90 (0.80, 1.01), and 0.93 (0.83, 1.05) mmol/L for INC, and 0.65 (0.59, 0.72), 0.79 (0.72, 0.87), 0.94 (0.84, 1.06), and 0.92 (0.82, 1.04) mmol/L for CON. Cows in INC group had lower ketonemia during the 4 to 7 DIM period. Predicted prevalence of HYK during the 1 to 3, 4 to 7, 8 to 17, and 18 to 26 DIM periods were, respectively, 2.8 (3.2, 15.1), 4.6 (2.0, 10.0), 13.4 (8.4, 20.0), and 23.0% (17.4, 29.7) for INC and 2.6 (2.5, 13.8), 10.7 (5.6, 19.3), 19.4 (13.0, 27.9), and 21.3% (16.0, 27.8) for CON. The INC treatment reduced the prevalence of HYK during the 4 to 7 and 8 to 17 DIM periods. No association was observed between INC and BCS loss in the postcalving period.

Twelve multiparous Jersey cows (mean ± standard deviation; 192 ± 11 d in milk; 467 ± 47 kg) in a crossover design with 28-d periods (24-d adaptation and 4-d collection) were used to compare 2 treatment diets. Treatments were high starch (HS; 30.8% starch, 31.8% neutral detergent fiber, and 1.9% fatty acids) or high fat (HF; 16.8% starch, 41.7% neutral detergent fiber, and 4.1% fatty acids). Diets were formulated to have net energy for lactation (NEL) content of 1.55 Mcal/kg of dry matter according to the National Research Council (2001) dairy model. Nutrient composition was varied primarily by replacing corn grain in HS with a rumen-inert fat source and cottonseed hulls in HF. Gross energy content was lower for HS (4.43 vs. 4.54 ± 0.01 Mcal/kg of dry matter), whereas digestible (2.93 vs. 2.74 ± 0.035 Mcal/kg of dry matter) and metabolizable energy (2.60 vs. 2.41 ± 0.030 Mcal/kg of dry matter), and NEL (1.83 vs. 1.67 ± 0.036 Mcal/kg of dry matter) content were all greater than for HF. Tissue energy deposited as body fat tended to be greater for HS (4.70 vs. 2.14 ± 1.01 Mcal/d). For N partitioning, HS increased milk N secretion (141 vs. 131 ± 10.5 g/d) and decreased urinary N excretion (123 vs. 150 ± 6.4 g/d). Compared with HF, HS increased apparent total-tract digestibility of dry matter (66.7 vs. 61.7 ± 1.06%), organic matter (68.5 vs. 63.2 ± 0.98%), energy (66.0 vs. 60.4 ± 0.92%), and 18-carbon fatty acids (67.9 vs. 61.2 ± 1.60%). However, apparent total-tract digestibility of starch decreased for HS from 97.0 to 94.5 ± 0.48%. Compared with HF, HS tended to increase milk yield (19.7 vs. 18.9 ± 1.38 kg/d), milk protein content (4.03 vs. 3.93 ± 0.10%), milk protein yield (0.791 vs. 0.740 ± 0.050 kg/d), and milk lactose yield (0.897 vs. 0.864 ± 0.067 kg/d). In addition, HS decreased milk fat content (5.93 vs. 6.37 ± 0.15%) but did not affect milk fat yield (average of 1.19 ± 0.09 kg/d) or energy-corrected milk yield (average of 27.2 ± 1.99 kg/d). Results of the current study suggest that the HS diet had a greater metabolizable energy and NEL content, increased partitioning of N toward milk secretion and away from urinary excretion, and may have increased partitioning of energy toward tissue energy deposited as fat.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Morris","given":"D.

Treatment effects were assessed using multivariable mixed logistic regression models for binary health and reproductive outcomes; linear regression models for milk yield, dry matter intake, and liver outcomes; and survival analysis for time insemination and pregnancy. In experiment 1, treatment did not have an effect on the incidence of hyperketonemia (blood β-hydroxybutyrate ≥ 1.2 mmol/L; cumulative incidence to 3 wk postpartum of 28 to 30%), clinical health disorders, or udder edema. The prevalence of anovulation at 8 wk postpartum was 11% in the treatment group and 23% in the control but did not differ statistically given group-level randomization. Pregnancy at first insemination (33 and 35%) and median time to pregnancy to 200 d in milk (96 and 97 d) were not different between treatment and control, respectively. No difference was observed between treatment groups in milk yield or components through the first 3 Dairy Herd Improvement Association test days (44 kg/d in both groups, accounting for parity and components). In experiment 2, there were no differences between treatment groups in feed intake. Mean blood β-hydroxybutyrate was lower at wk 3 in RPBC (0.6 vs. 0.9 ± 0.12 mmol/L) with no difference between treatments for mean blood concentrations of fatty acids (wk −1 or 1) and β-hydroxybutyrate at wk 1 or 2. The gene for acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1) had lower mRNA abundance in RPBC with no difference between treatments for the other genes, but the expression of half of the genes assessed differed with days in milk. Liver triacylglycerol was lower in primiparous cows at 4 d in milk in RPBC (2.0 vs. 4.4 ± 1.2%) but not at 14 d in milk (2.2 vs. 3.2 ± 0.97%) with no treatment effect in multiparous cows (4.6 ± 0.8%). Accounting for parity, days in milk, fat and protein percentages, repeated test days, and a random effect of cow, no significant difference was observed between treatments in milk yield across the first 3 Dairy Herd Improvement Association tests (41.2 ± 1.3 in RPBC vs. 38.0 ± 1.4 kg/d in control). Under the diet and management conditions of the field study including low prevalence of clinical health disorders, in experiment 1 we did not detect a benefit of RPBC, but in experiment 2 liver fat content decreased in primiparous cows.","author":[{"family":"Morrison","given":"E.

  {"id":"Morton2014","abstract":"A controlled trial was conducted in 5 pasture-grazed commercial dairy herds in Australia in 2012 to determine whether premilking teat disinfection and drying of teats reduces clinical mastitis incidence during early lactation by at least 50%. A 50% reduction was estimated to be the minimum required to justify additional costs of labor, disinfectants, and other resources if premilking teat disinfection was implemented in a 500-cow herd averaging 8 clinical cases per 100 cow-months. A secondary aim was to determine whether this premilking teat disinfection routine reduces incidence of new udder infections. Treatment was applied in each herd for approximately 60 d (range of 59.5 to 61 d), commencing in each herd soon after the start of the herd's main or only calving period. Within each herd, cows were allocated to either the treatment (premilking disinfection) or the control (no premilking disinfection) group based on their herd identity number. During the trial period, any cow having a new case of clinical mastitis or an individual cow cell count greater than 250,000 cells/mL of milk (when preceded by individual cow cell counts of 250,000 cells/mL of milk or below) was deemed to have had a new infection. Overall, neither clinical mastitis incidence nor new infection rate differed significantly between treatment and control groups. Over the whole study period, 98 of the 1,029 cows in the premilking disinfection group and 97 of the 1,025 cows in the control group had clinical mastitis. Total cow-days at risk of clinical mastitis were similar in each group. However, clinical incidence rates were markedly lower in treatment cows in one herd (herd 3; incidence rate ratio=0.34) and there was some evidence that new infection incidence rates were lower in treated cows in this herd (incidence rate ratio=0.42). Rainfall during the study period was below long-term district average in all 5 study herds. Cows' teats were less dirty than in previous, wetter years for the 4 herds where no significant clinical mastitis response was detected but some teat soiling was observed in herd 3 during the study period. Routine application of premilking teat disinfection in pasture-grazed herds is unlikely to produce a worthwhile (economic) reduction in the number of clinical mastitis cases when teats are relatively clean and dry and the clinical mastitis incidence is low. However, premilking disinfection might be worthwhile during periods when teats are heavily soiled and the incidence of clinical mastitis due to environmental pathogens is high.","author":[{"family":"Morton","given":"John M."},{"family":"Penry","given":"John F."},{"family":"Malmo","given":"Jakob"},{"family":"Mein","given":"Graeme A."}],"citation-key":"Morton2014","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2014-8185","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"7525-7537","PMID":"25282424","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Premilking teat disinfection: Is it worthwhile in pasture-grazed dairy herds?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030214006663","volume":"97"},

  {"id":"moser2009","abstract":"BACKGROUND:Genomic selection (GS) uses molecular\nbreeding values (MBV) derived from dense markers\nacross the entire genome for selection of young\nanimals. The accuracy of MBV prediction is important\nfor a successful application of GS. Recently,\nseveral methods have been proposed to estimate\nMBV. Initial simulation studies have shown that\nthese methods can accurately predict MBV. In this\nstudy we compared the accuracies and possible bias\nof five different regression methods in an empirical\napplication in dairy cattle.METHODS:Genotypes of\n7,372 SNP and highly accurate EBV of 1,945 dairy\nbulls were used to predict MBV for protein\npercentage (PPT) and a profit index (Australian\nSelection Index, ASI). Marker effects were estimated\nby least squares regression (FR-LS), Bayesian\nregression (Bayes-R), random regression best linear\nunbiased prediction (RR-BLUP), partial least squares\nregression (PLSR) and nonparametric support vector\nregression (SVR) in a training set of 1,239\nbulls. Accuracy and bias of MBV prediction were\ncalculated from cross-validation of the training set\nand tested against a test team of 706 young\nbulls.RESULTS:For both traits, FR-LS using a subset\nof SNP was significantly less accurate than all\nother methods which used all SNP. Accuracies\nobtained by Bayes-R, RR-BLUP, PLSR and SVR were very\nsimilar for ASI (0.39-0.45) and for PPT\n(0.55-0.61). Overall, SVR gave the highest accuracy.\nAll methods resulted in biased MBV predictions for\nASI, for PPT only RR-BLUP and SVR predictions were\nunbiased. A significant decrease in accuracy of\nprediction of ASI was seen in young test cohorts of\nbulls compared to the accuracy derived from\ncross-validation of the training set. This reduction\nwas not apparent for PPT. Combining MBV predictions\nwith pedigree based predictions gave 1.05 - 1.34\ntimes higher accuracies compared to predictions\nbased on pedigree alone. Some methods have largely\ndifferent computational requirements, with PLSR and\nRR-BLUP requiring the least computing\ntime.CONCLUSIONS:The four methods which use\ninformation from all SNP namely RR-BLUP, Bayes-R,\nPLSR and SVR generate similar accuracies of MBV\nprediction for genomic selection, and their use in\nthe selection of immediate future generations in\ndairy cattle will be comparable. The use of FR-LS in\ngenomic selection is not recommended.","author":[{"family":"Moser","given":"Gerhard"},{"family":"Tier","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Crump","given":"Ron"},{"family":"Khatkar","given":"Mehar"},{"family":"Raadsma","given":"Herman"}],"citation-key":"moser2009","container-title":"Genet Sel Evol","DOI":"10.1186/1297-9686-41-56","ISSN":"1297-9686","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"page":"56","title":"A comparison of five methods to predict genomic breeding values of dairy bulls from genome-wide SNP markers","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.gsejournal.org/content/41/1/56","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"mukladaEffectWillowFodder","abstract":"In a previous study, we showed that access to willow fodder decreased somatic cell counts (SCC) in the milk of local Mamber goats grazing in brushland at the end of lactation. To test whether the consumption of willow affects the cells of the immune system, Alpine crossbred dairy goats grazing in the same environment were either offered free access to freshly cut willow fodder (W, n = 24) or not (C, n = 24) for 2 weeks. The willow fodder contained 7.5 g/kg DM of salicin. The other major secondary compounds were catechin, myricitrin, hyperin and chlorogenic acid (2.2, 2.6, 1.0 and 0.75 g/kg DM, respectively). Udder health status was determined before the experiment, and each of the two groups included five (W) or six (C) goats defined as infected, as established by microbial cfu in milk, and 19 (W) or 18 (C) non-infected goats. Goats ingested, on average, 600 g of DM from willow (25% of food intake), resulting in minor changes in dietary quality compared to the controls, as established by faecal near-IR spectrometry. Throughout the 2 weeks of experiment, differences between groups in dietary CP contents were minor and affected neither by infection nor by access to willow; the dietary percentage of neutral detergent fibre (NDF) decreased in C and increased in W; dietary acid detergent fibre (ADF) increased; and the dietary tannin contents decreased for both treatments. However, milking performance and milk quality attributes in both W and C goats were similar. Initial SCC and milk neutrophil (cluster of differentiation (CD)18 þ and porcine granulocyte (PG)68) cell counts were higher in infected than in non-infected goats; counts decreased significantly in W but not in C uninfected goats. The percentage of CD8 þ T-cells increased in all C goats, while in the W group, a significant increase was found only for infected goats. The consumption of willow mitigated an increase in CD8 þ in blood and triggered an increase in CD8 þ in milk, suggesting an immune-regulatory effect independent of udder status. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a direct nutraceutical effect of fodder ingestion on the immune status of goats.","author":[{"family":"Muklada","given":"H"},{"family":"Voet","given":"H"},{"family":"Deutch","given":"T"},{"family":"Zachut","given":"M"},{"family":"Kra","given":"G"},{"family":"Blum","given":"S E"},{"family":"Krifuks","given":"O"},{"family":"Glasser","given":"T A"},{"family":"Klein","given":"J D"},{"family":"Davidovich-Rikanati","given":"R"},{"family":"Lewinsohn","given":"E"},{"family":"Landau","given":"S Y"}],"citation-key":"mukladaEffectWillowFodder","DOI":"10.1017/S1751731120001494","title":"The effect of willow fodder feeding on immune cell populations in the blood and milk of late-lactating dairy goats","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S1751731120001494"},
  {"id":"mumpton1999","abstract":"For nearly 200 years since their discovery in 1756, geologists considered the zeolite minerals to occur as fairly large crystals in the vugs and cavities of basalts and other traprock formations. Here, they were prized by mineral collectors, but their small abundance and polymineralic nature defied commercial exploitation. As the synthetic zeolite (molecular sieve) business began to take hold in the late 1950s, huge beds of zeolite-rich sediments, formed by the alteration of volcanic ash (glass) in lake and marine waters, were discovered in the western United States and elsewhere in the world. These beds were found to contain as much as 95% of a single zeolite; they were generally flat-lying and easily mined by surface methods. The properties of these low-cost natural materials mimicked those of many of their synthetic counterparts, and considerable effort has made since that time to develop applications for them based on their unique adsorption, cation-exchange, dehydration–rehydration, and catalytic properties. Natural zeolites (i.e., those found in volcanogenic sedimentary rocks) have been and are being used as building stone, as lightweight aggregate and pozzolans in cements and concretes, as filler in paper, in the take-up of Cs and Sr from nuclear waste and fallout, as soil amendments in agronomy and horticulture, in the removal of ammonia from municipal, industrial, and agricultural waste and drinking waters, as energy exchangers in solar refrigerators, as dietary supplements in animal diets, as consumer deodorizers, in pet litters, in taking up ammonia from animal manures, and as ammonia filters in kidney-dialysis units. From their use in construction during Roman times, to their role as hydroponic (zeoponic) substrate for growing plants on space missions, to their recent success in the healing of cuts and wounds, natural zeolites are now considered to be full-fledged mineral commodities, the use of which promise to expand even more in the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Mumpton","given":"Frederick A."}],"citation-key":"mumpton1999","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.96.7.3463","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",3,30]]},"page":"3463-3470","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"pnas.org (Atypon)","title":"La roca magica: Uses of natural zeolites in agriculture and industry","title-short":"La roca magica","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.96.7.3463","volume":"96"},

  {"id":"Muthaiyan2011","abstract":"Bioethanol continues to be offered as a viable solution for complex problems ranging from global warming and national energy security to local economic development. Fuel bioethanol burns cleaner than gasoline, is derived from renewable agricultural products, and creates local jobs and income. In December 2007, President Bush signed into law the Energy Independence and Security Act, which increased the renewable fuel standard that was mandated under energy Policy Act of 2005 to 36 billion gallons by 2022.In order to achieve this goal, ethanol production would need to be generated primarily from corn and cellulosic materials. Bioethanol producers are currently involved in variety of technological innovations to reduce energy consumption and production costs, increased efficiency and reduced emissions using the best available control technologies. However, industrial ethanol fermentation is a non-sterile process and contaminant microorganisms can lead to a decrease in industrial productivity and significant economic loss. Currently, bioethanol industries use different antimicrobials including antibiotics to control the contaminants in the fermentors. The emergence of antibiotic resistance among contaminant bacteria in bioethanol fermentors warrants the need for alternative antimicrobials to retain bioethanol production at a profitable level. In addition more and more ethanol producers are seeking to generate distillers grains that can be labeled antibiotic free to be sold in international markets where some restrictions are already in place for reducing and/or eliminating antibiotics usage in animal feed. This review examines the contamination problems, various intervention methods, emergence of antibiotic resistance in contaminant bacteria, and potential alternative options to elucidate antimicrobial products from various natural sources. In particular, emphasis has been given for natural antibacterial products from plant derived products to suggest a new research avenue for the search of new, non-conventional antimicrobial agents to control the contamination problem in the fuel bioethanol industries. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

  {"id":"Mutsvangwa2016","abstract":"The objective of this study was to determine the effects of feeding canola meal (CM) or wheat dried distillers grains with solubles (W-DDGS) as the major source of protein in diets varying in crude protein (CP) content on ruminal fermentation, microbial protein production, omasal nutrient flow, and production performance in lactating dairy cows. Eight lactating dairy cows were used in a replicated 4×4 Latin square design with 29-d periods (21d of dietary adaptation and 8d of measurements) and a 2×2 factorial arrangement of dietary treatments. Four cows in 1 Latin square were ruminally cannulated to allow ruminal and omasal sampling. The treatment factors were (1) source of supplemental protein (CM vs. W-DDGS) and (2) dietary CP content (15 vs. 17%; DM basis). Diets contained 50% forage and 50% concentrate, and were fed twice daily at 0900 and 1600 h as total mixed rations for ad libitum intake. Dry matter intake and milk yield were unaffected by dietary treatments; however, milk yield in cows that were fed CM was numerically greater (+1.1kg/d) when compared with cows fed W-DDGS. Feeding CM increased milk lactose content compared with feeding W-DDGS. Milk urea nitrogen and ruminal NH3-N concentrations were greater in cows fed the high-CP compared with those fed the low-CP diet. The rumen-degradable protein supply was greater in cows fed the high-CP when compared with those fed the low-CP diet when diets contained CM, whereas rumen-degradable protein supply was lower in cows fed the high-CP when compared with those fed the low-CP diet when diets contained W-DDGS. Total N flow at the omasal canal was not affected by diet; however, omasal flow of NH3-N was greater in cows fed CM when compared with those fed W-DDGS. The rumen-undegradable protein supply was greater in cows fed the low-CP when compared with those fed the high-CP diet when diets contained CM, whereas rumen-undegradable protein supply was lower in cows fed the low-CP when compared with those fed the high-CP diet when diets contained W-DDGS. Omasal flow of fluid-associated bacteria was greater and that of particle-associated bacteria tended to be greater in cows fed CM when compared with those fed W-DDGS; however, omasal flow of total microbial nonammonia N was unaffected by dietary treatment. Omasal flows of threonine and tryptophan were greater, whereas that of histidine and lysine tended to be greater in cows fed CM when compared with those fed W-DDGS. Our results show that when dairy diets are formulated to contain 15 or 17% CP, CM or W-DDGS can be used as the major source of protein and achieve similar levels of milk production.","author":[{"family":"Mutsvangwa","given":"T."},{"family":"Kiran","given":"D."},{"family":"Abeysekara","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"Mutsvangwa2016","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2015-9991","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"1216-1227","PMID":"26709161","title":"Effects of feeding canola meal or wheat dried distillers grains with solubles as a major protein source in low- or high-crude protein diets on ruminal fermentation, omasal flow, and production in cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002203021500925X","volume":"99"},

  {"id":"Næss2011","abstract":"Freestall housing for dairy cows has many different layouts and the space allocated for cows differs considerably. The objective of the present study was to investigate possible associations between barn layout and milk yield for different parities in small dairy freestall barns. Layouts of 204 Norwegian freestall barns constructed during the period from 1995 to 2005, and with a mean herd size of 42.7±15.5 cows, were obtained and merged with milk yield data and calving interval, for each parity, from the Norwegian Milk Recording System (NDHRS). The milk yield data set contained 20,221 different lactations from these 204 herds. Both simple mixed models, including the different explanatory variables one by one together with parity, calving interval, and herd as random effect, and a final mixed model, including all significant explanatory variables, were created. According to variables tested in this study, the final mixed model estimates show that only primiparous cows benefit significantly from increased free space allocation. Milk yield was generally higher in automatic milking system barns compared with that in barns with milking parlors, but not for primiparous cows. Milk yield was higher for all parities for barns using separation pens in accordance with the recommendations. Barns with 2 or more dead-end alleys had lower milk yield compared with that from layouts without dead-end alleys. Primiparous cows benefited from water troughs located for easy access and responded with increased milk yield. In 10% of the barns, the water trough capacity was less than 47% of the recommendations, and all parities benefited from a water trough capacity higher than this level. Higher parities had increased milk yield when water trough capacity was more than 80%. Feed bunk space, number of freestall rows, and the location of freestalls had no significant effect on the milk yield. The present study showed that increased space and improved access to water is beneficial to primiparous cows, whereas layouts without dead-end alleys and improved water capacity is beneficial for all cows in freestall systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Næss","given":"G"},{"family":"Bøe","given":"K E"},{"family":"Osterås","given":"O"}],"citation-key":"Næss2011","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2010-3422","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",3]]},"page":"1256-64","PMID":"21338791","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Layouts for small freestall dairy barns: effect on milk yield for cows in different parities.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21338791","volume":"94"},

  {"id":"Naseeven1992","abstract":"Wheat straw was treated with anhydrous NH3 at 0, 1.75 or 3.50% of dry matter (DM) and then with SO2 (0, 2, 3, 4 and 5% DM) for either 3 or 7 days. Dry matter degradability (DMD) was measured using an in situ nylon bag technique. Nitrogen retention and DMD of the wheat straw was increased by the ammoniation (P < 0.001, linear and quadratic) with a significant NH3 × SO2 interaction (P < 0.05). Main effects for SO2 also showed increased DMD and crude protein (CP) at 0, 2, 3, 4 and 5% levels (P < 0.001). The 7 day treatment with SO2 resulted in increased DMD (62.0% vs. 59.7%, P < 0.001). Two feeding trials were conducted with wheat straw treated with either NH3 alone or a combination of NH3 and SO2. In Study 1, growing beef heifers were fed: (a) untreated straw (US); (b) ammoniated straw (AS); (c) NH3 + SO2 treated straw; (d) NH3 + SO2 treated straw (43% DM) and hay (57% DM); (e) bromegrass hay (H) alone fed ad libitum. All heifers received 1.3 kg of supplement in two daily meals. Intake of NH3 + SO2 treated straw for the first 28 days was very low compared with AS (1.8 kg vs. 3.8 kg), resulting in severe weight loss (-600 g day-1). This treatment was replaced by a mixture of NH3 + SO2 treated straw (43% DM) and haylage (57% DM) for the rest of the trial (10 weeks). Ammoniation of wheat straw did not significantly increase DM intakes (DMI) compared with US (5.99 kg day-1 vs. 5.12 kg day-1, P > 0.05) but improved average daily gain (ADG) (510 g vs. 347 g, P < 0.02). Heifers fed NH3 + SO2 treated straw and either haylage or hay consumed more feed (7.27 kg day-1 and 8.07 kg day-1 vs. 5.99 kg day-1) and gained more weight (833 g day-1 and 816 g day-1 vs. 510 g day-1) than animals fed AS. Animals fed H had DMI and ADG values similar to those fed NH3 + SO2 treated straw and hay (P > 0.05). The second trial was done to determine the effects of chemical treatment of straw on ruminal function and fiber digestion. The diets, offered ad libitum with a supplement, were US, AS, NH3 + SO2 treated straw alone and with hay. There was no effect of diet on ruminal dilution rate. The DMD values of the US, AS, NH3 + SO2 treated straw, and H were 48%, 58%, 68% and 62%, respectively. When fed as the only forage, NH3 + SO2 treated straw resulted in anorexia and weight loss; however, when fed at 43% of diet DM, feed intakes and weight gains of heifers were better than AS and similar to H. In summary, the combined use of NH3 and SO2 at ambient temperatures has potential as a practical method for treatment of wheat straw. © 1992.","author":[{"family":"Naseeven","given":"M.

  {"id":"Nayeri2014","abstract":"Multiparous (n=70) and primiparous (n=66) Holstein cows were balanced by 305-d previous mature-equivalent milk yield and parity and assigned to 1 of 3 dietary treatments to evaluate the ratio of zinc sulfate to zinc amino acid complex (CZ) in pre- and postpartum Holstein cows fed diets containing 75mg of added zinc/kg. Treatments were (1) 75mg of supplemental zinc/kg of dry matter (DM) provided entirely as zinc sulfate (0-CZ); (2) 0-CZ diet, except 33.3mg of zinc sulfate/kg of DM in the prepartum and 15.5mg of zinc sulfate/kg of DM in the postpartum diet were replaced by CZ from Availa-Zn (16-CZ; Zinpro Corp., Eden Prairie MN); and (3) 0-CZ diet, except 66.6mg of zinc sulfate/kg of DM in the prepartum and 40.0mg of zinc sulfate/kg of DM in the postpartum diet was replaced by Availa-Zn (40-CZ). Cows were housed at the Iowa State University Dairy Farm and were individually offered a total mixed ration containing dietary treatments beginning at 28±15d before expected calving date until 250 d in milk. Relative to 0-CZ, multiparous cows (but not primiparous) fed CZ (16-CZ or 40-CZ) had increased (20%) colostrum IgG concentrations. Prepartum DM intake (DMI) was decreased with CZ supplementation. Postpartum DMI was decreased in cows fed CZ, whereas milk yield (MY) was increased in the 40-CZ-fed cows relative to those fed both 0-CZ and 16-CZ. Feed efficiency increased linearly when measured as MY/DMI, 3.5% fat-corrected MY/DMI, and solids-corrected MY/DMI. Regardless of level, feeding CZ decreased services per conception. Feeding 16-CZ decreased milk fat concentration and feeding CZ linearly increased milk urea nitrogen concentration. In summary, supplementing zinc as a mixture of CZ and zinc sulfate, as opposed to supplementing only zinc sulfate, has beneficial effects on production parameters in dairy cows, with those benefits becoming more apparent as the ratio of CZ to zinc sulfate increases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Nayeri","given":"a"},{"family":"Upah","given":"N C"},{"family":"Sucu","given":"E"},{"family":"Sanz-Fernandez","given":"M V"},{"family":"DeFrain","given":"J M"},{"family":"Gorden","given":"P J"},{"family":"Baumgard","given":"L H"}],"citation-key":"Nayeri2014","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2013-7541","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",7]]},"page":"4392-404","PMID":"24819137","title":"Effect of the ratio of zinc amino acid complex to zinc sulfate on the performance of Holstein cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819137","volume":"97"},

  {"id":"Nemec2012","abstract":"The aim of this study was to compare effects of inorganic sulfate versus chelated forms of supplemental Cu, Mn, and Zn on milk production, plasma and milk mineral concentrations, neutrophil activity, and antibody titer response to a model vaccination. Holstein cows (n=25) were assigned in 2 cohorts based on calving date to a 12-wk randomized complete block design study. The first cohort consisted of 17 cows that had greater days in milk (DIM; mean of 77 DIM at the start of the trial) than the second cohort of 8 cows (32 DIM at the start of the trial). Diets were formulated to supplement 100% of National Research Council requirements of Cu, Mn, and Zn by either inorganic trace minerals (ITM) in sulfate forms or chelated trace minerals (CTM) supplied as metal methionine hydroxy analog chelates, without accounting for trace mineral contribution from other dietary ingredients. Intake and milk production were recorded daily. Milk composition was measured weekly, and milk Cu, Mn, and Zn were determined at wk 0 and 8. Plasma Cu and Zn concentrations and neutrophil activity were measured at wk 0, 4, 8, and 12. Neutrophil activity was measured by in vitro assays of chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and reactive oxygen species production. A rabies vaccination was administered at wk 8, and vaccine titer response at wk 12 was measured by both rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test and ELISA. Analyzed dietary Cu was 21 and 23mg/kg, Mn was 42 and 46mg/kg, and Zn was 73 and 94mg/kg for the ITM and CTM diets, respectively. No effect of treatment was observed on milk production, milk composition, or plasma minerals. Dry matter intake was reduced for CTM compared with ITM cows, but this was largely explained by differences in body weight between treatments. Milk Cu concentration was greater for CTM than ITM cows, but this effect was limited to the earlier DIM cohort of cows and was most pronounced for multiparous compared with primiparous cows. Measures of neutrophil function were unaffected by treatment except for an enhancement in neutrophil phagocytosis with the CTM treatment found for the later DIM cohort of cows only. Rabies antibody titer in CTM cows was 2.8 fold that of ITM cows as measured by ELISA, with a trend for the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test. Supplementation of Cu, Mn, and Zn as chelated sources may enhance immune response of early lactation dairy cows compared with cows supplemented with inorganic sources.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Nemec","given":"L M"},{"family":"Richards","given":"J D"},{"family":"Atwell","given":"C","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Diaz","given":"D E"},{"family":"Zanton","given":"G I"},{"family":"Gressley","given":"T F"}],"citation-key":"Nemec2012","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5404","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",8]]},"page":"4568-77","PMID":"22818471","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Immune responses in lactating Holstein cows supplemented with Cu, Mn, and Zn as sulfates or methionine hydroxy analogue chelates.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22818471","volume":"95"},
  {"id":"nevesMethodComparisonValidation2018","abstract":"The objective of this study was to assess an optimized ion-selective electrode Ca-module prototype as a potential cow-side device for ionized Ca (iCa) measurements in bovine blood. A linearity experiment showed no deviation from linearity over a range of iCa concentrations compared with a commercial point-of-care (POC) device commonly used in the field (POC VS ; VetScan i-STAT, Abaxis North America, Union City, CA) and a laboratory gold standard benchtop blood-gas analyzer [reference analyzer (RA); ABL-800 FLEX, Radiometer Medical, Copenhagen, Denmark]. Coefficient of variation on 3 samples with high, within-range, and low iCa concentrations ranged from 1.0 to 3.9% for the prototype. A follow-up validation experiment was performed, in which our objectives were to (1) assess the performance of the prototype cow-side against the POC VS (farm gold-standard) using fresh non-anticoagulated whole-blood samples; (2) assess the performance of the prototype and the POC VS against the RA in a diagnostic laboratory using blood collected in a heparin-balanced syringe; and (3) assess the agreement of the prototype and POC VS on-farm (fresh non-anticoagulated whole blood) against the RA on heparin-balanced blood. Finally, sensitivity and specificity of the results obtained by the prototype and the POC VS cow-side compared with the results obtained by the laboratory RA using 3 different iCa cut points for classification of subclinical hypocalcemia were calculated. A total of 101 periparturient Holstein cows from 3 dairy farms in New York State were used for the second experiment. Ionized Ca results from the prototype cow-side were, on average, 0.06 mmol/L higher than the POC VS . With heparin-balanced samples under laboratory conditions, the prototype and POC VS measured an average 0.04 mmol/L higher and lower, respectively, compared with the RA. Results from the prototype and POC VS cow-side were 0.01 mmol/L higher and 0.05 mmol/L lower, respectively, compared with results from the laboratory RA on heparinized blood. Sensitivity and specificity for the prototype and the POC VS under farm conditions at 3 potential subclinical hypocalcemia cut points were 100 and ≥93.5%, respectively. This novel ion-selective electrode Ca-module could become a rapid low-cost tool for assessing iCa cow-side, while qualitatively allowing classification of subclinical hypocalcemia on-farm.","author":[{"family":"Neves","given":"R.

  {"id":"Neveu2013","abstract":"Twenty Holstein cows were used in a Latin square design experiment with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement to determine the effects of extruded flaxseed (EF) supplementation with 2 different forage to concentrate ratios on the performance of dairy cows. Extruded flaxseed diets contained 9% (dry matter basis) EF product which consisted of 75% EF and 25% ground alfalfa meal. Four lactating Holsteins cows fitted with rumen fistulae were used to determine the effects of dietary treatments on ruminal fermentation. Intakes of dry matter and crude protein were not influenced by dietary treatments. However, neutral detergent fiber intake was greater for the high-forage (8.4 kg/d) than the low-forage (7.8 kg/d) diet. Milk yield (average 40.2 kg/d) was similar for all dietary treatments. However, cows fed the high-forage diets produced milk with higher fat (3.76 vs. 2.97%) and total solids (12.58 vs. 11.95%) concentrations, but lower protein (3.19 vs. 3.33%) and lactose (4.66 vs. 4.72%) contents. Ruminal pH and total volatile fatty acid concentration were not affected by dietary treatments. However, feeding high forage relative to low forage diets increased molar proportion of acetate but decreased that of propionate. Ruminal NH3-N was reduced by feeding high forage relative to low forage diets. Milk fatty acid composition was altered by both forage level and EF supplementation. Feeding diets containing EF or low forage reduced the concentrations of saturated fatty acids and increased those of mono-unsaturated fatty acids. Concentrations of poly-unsaturated fatty acids were increased by feeding EF or low-forage diets. Extruded flaxseed supplementation increased milk fat α-linolenic acid content by 100% and conjugated linoleic acid by 54%. It was concluded that differences in animal performance and ruminal fermentation observed in this study were mostly due to differences in forage to concentrate ratio. However, EF supplementation caused most of the differences observed in milk fatty acid composition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Neveu","given":"C"},{"family":"Baurhoo","given":"B"},{"family":"Mustafa","given":"a"}],"citation-key":"Neveu2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-6189","ISSN":"1525-3198","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",4,19]]},"page":"1-9","PMID":"23608490","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Effect of feeding extruded flaxseed with different forage:concentrate ratios on the performance of dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23608490"},

Three leafy corn silage hybrids were harvested at NC and HC at about 34% dry matter (E) and 41% DM (L) and ensiled in laboratory silos. Increasing the height of cutting lowered yields of harvested DM/ha. In addition, the concentrations of DM and starch were higher but the concentrations of lactic acid, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber were lower in HC than in NC. The concentration of acid detergent lignin was also lower in HC, but only in corn harvested at E. In vitro digestion (30 h) of NDF was greater in HC (50.7%) than NC (48.3%). Calculated yield of milk per tonne of forage DM was greater for HC than for NC at E but not at L. In a lactation experiment, increasing the height of cutting of another leafy corn silage hybrid, TMF29400, in general also resulted in similar changes in nutrient composition as just described. When fed to lactating dairy cows, HC corn silage resulted in tendencies for greater NDF digestion in the total tract, higher milk production and improved feed efficiency, but there were no differences in 3.5% fat corrected milk between treatments. Results of this study suggest that increasing the cutting height of whole plant corn at harvest can improve the nutritive value of corn silage for lactating dairy cows.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Neylon","given":"J M"},{"family":"Kung","given":"L"}],"citation-key":"Neylon2003","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(03)73806-5","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",6]]},"page":"2163-9","PMID":"12836953","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effects of cutting height and maturity on the nutritive value of corn silage for lactating cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12836953","volume":"86"},

Diets were arranged in a 2 x 4 factorial design and were fed to lactating cows (n = 24; pretrial mean milk production = 39 kg/d; body weight = 656 kg; and days in milk = 81). As concentrations of dietary NDF increased, intake and milk production decreased linearly. The impact of dietary NDF on intake was greater for diets based on tropical corn silage than for diets based on sorghum silage. Energy intake and milk production were reduced, but cows consumed more fiber when challenged with higher dietary concentrations of fiber. The in vitro rate and extent of digestion of dietary samples were correlated with intake response. The rate of in vitro fiber digestion was slower for samples that contained tropical corn silage than for samples that contained sorghum silage.

  {"id":"Nichols2019","abstract":"This study tested the effects of energy from glucogenic (glucose; GG) or lipogenic (palm olein; LG) substrates at low (LMP) and high (HMP) metabolizable protein levels on whole-body energy and N partitioning of dairy cattle. Six rumen-fistulated, second-lactation Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (97 ± 13 d in milk) were randomly assigned to a 6 × 6 Latin square design in which each experimental period consisted of 5 d of continuous abomasal infusion followed by 2 d of rest. A total mixed ration consisting of 42% corn silage, 31% grass silage, and 27% concentrate (dry matter basis) was formulated to meet 100 and 83% of net energy and metabolizable protein requirements, respectively, and was fed at 90% of ad libitum intake by individual cow. Abomasal infusion treatments were saline (LMP-C), isoenergetic infusions (digestible energy basis) of 1,319 g/d of glucose (LMP-GG), 676 g/d of palm olein (LMP-LG; major fatty acid constituents are palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acid), or 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-C), or isoenergetic infusions of 1,319 g/d of glucose + 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-GG) or 676 g/d of palm olein + 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-LG). The experiment was conducted in climate respiration chambers to determine energy and N balance in conjunction with milk production and composition, nutrient digestibility, and plasma constituents. Infusion of GG and LG decreased dry matter intake, but total gross energy intake from the diet plus infusions was not affected by GG or LG. Furthermore, GG or LG did not affect total milk, protein, or lactose yields. Infusing GG or LG at the HMP level did not affect milk production differently than at the LMP level. Infusion of GG stimulated energy retention in body tissue, increased plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, decreased lipogenic metabolites in plasma, and decreased milk fat yield and milk energy output. Nitrogen intake decreased and milk N efficiency increased in response to GG, and N retention was not affected. Infusion of LG tended to increase metabolizable energy intake, increased milk fat yield and milk energy output, increased plasma triacylglycerides and long-chain fatty acid concentrations, and had no effect on energy retention. Infusion of LG decreased N intake but did not affect milk N efficiency or N retention. Compared with the LMP level, the HMP level increased dry matter intake, gross and metabolizable energy intake, and total milk, fat, protein, and lactose yields. Milk energy output increased at the HMP level, and protein level did not affect total energy retention. Heat production increased at the HMP level, but only when GG and LG were infused. The HMP level increased N intake, milk N output, and plasma urea concentration, tended to increase N retention, and decreased milk N efficiency. Regardless of protein level, GG promoted energy retention and improved milk N efficiency, but not through increased milk protein yield. Infusion of LG partitioned extra energy intake into milk and had no effect on milk N efficiency.","author":[{"family":"Nichols","given":"K."},{"family":"Dijkstra","given":"J."},{"family":"Laar","given":"H.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Pacheco","given":"S."},{"family":"Valenberg","given":"H.

  {"id":"Nickerson2019","abstract":"A trial was conducted to determine if feeding OmniGen-AF® (OG) to 22 late lactation cows 60 days prior to and during the early dry period, a time of increased susceptibility to mastitis, could reduce disease incidence in a dairy herd experiencing major health issues. Treated cows (n = 11) consumed a ration containing OG [9 g/100 kg of body weight/day] beginning 60 days before dry-off, during the dry period, and through 30 days in milk (DIM). Control cows received the same ration during the dry period through 30 DIM only. Body weights, body condition scores (BCS), intramammary infection (IMI) prevalence, new IMI rates, somatic cell counts (SCC), milk yield, and adverse health events were measured. No differences were found between treatments for body weight or BCS. Adverse health event data at calving showed no differences between treatments except for percentage of cows with hyperketonemia, which was lower among treated cows (63.6% vs 100%). Prevalence of IMI from calving through 30 DIM for treated cows (6.1%) was lower than controls (11.05%); likewise, new IMI rate during this time for treated cows (0.61%) was lower than controls (5.81%). The SCC from calving through 30 DIM for treated cows (215,000/ml) was lower than controls (493,000/ml). Average production/day at the first DHIA test (~33 DIM) showed that treated cows produced more milk (39.9 kg) than controls (35.34 kg). In conclusion, feeding OG 60 days prior to dry-off reduced hyperketonemia and mastitis, lowered SCC, and numerically increased milk yield in a dairy herd experiencing major health issues.","author":[{"family":"Nickerson","given":"S.

  {"id":"Nielsen2004","abstract":"The objective of this review was to describe how propylene glycol (PG) is metabolised in the rumen and liver and how it affects metabolites, hormones, liver composition, feed intake and milk production, in order to evaluate whether PG is likely to prevent excessive fat mobilisation and imbalances in carbohydrate and fat metabolism and thereby reduce the risk of ketosis. PG decreases the molar ratio of acetate to propionate in rumen volatile fatty acids (VFA) because part of PG is metabolised to propionate in the rumen. The remaining PG is absorbed directly from the rumen without alteration and enters gluconeogenesis via pyruvate. Oral administration of PG increases insulin by 200-400% within 30 min after drenching, indicating that PG is absorbed rather quickly. Allocation of PG also increases plasma glucose, although the response is limited, probably because of the large increase in insulin. PG decreases plasma concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), especially in early lactating cows with relatively high levels of NEFA. PG also reduces the triacylglycerol (TG) content of the liver and the concentrations of ketone bodies in milk and hence, has anti-ketogenic properties. Factors, such as metabolic status of the animals, time of blood sampling in relation to time of feeding PG, supplementation method and dose of PG influence the magnitude of the response in blood parameters. Generally, PG has no statistically significant effect on milk production, but for cows in early lactation PG tends to increase milk yield and reduce milk fat percentage, while milk protein percentage is unchanged. Thus, PG has no effect on energy corrected milk yield (ECM). In general, PG does not affect feed intake. However, due to its low palatability it may reduce feed intake if not mixed thoroughly with other feed components or drenched. PG may improve reproduction efficiency but more studies are needed to confirm this. PG has some side effects including ataxia, salivation, hyperventilation, and depression. However, only some cows show these signs and great variation in susceptibility is likely. The reducing effect of PG on NEFA, hepatic TG concentrations, and milk fat content indicate that PG increases energy balance of cows in early lactation. Together with the anti-ketogenic properties of PG, this suggests that PG may reduce the risk of subclinical and clinical ketosis. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Rumen nitrogen (N) release from ammoniated wet barley and maize kernels by urea treatment (UT) at harvesting was studied. Untreated samples (CTR) were compared to UT and to samples combined with urea just before the experiment (UA). In Experiment 1, ground CTR, UT and UA samples were fermented in a ruminal in vitro system, and ammonia of fermentation fluid was analysed at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h. The effect of incubation time was observed as ammonia peaked at 4 h of fermentation (10.24 vs 9.01 and 7.20 mg · dl−1, respectively at 0 and 8 h, P < 0.01). Also, the effect of treatment was stated when UT released less ammonia than UA treatment (9.76 vs 10.52 mg · dl−1, P < 0.05), while the CTR samples showed the least ammonia N concentrations (P < 0.01). In Experiment 2, the water N solubility of CTR and UT of both cereal samples prepared in three physical forms (whole grain, coarsely ground and milled) was examined. Samples were incubated in flasks with distilled water for 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h and N was measured in filtered residues to calculate N solubility. The UT samples, regardless cereal type, solubilised more N in the milled than in the whole form with the coarse form in the middle (43.7 vs 15.3%, 32.4 vs 14.0% and 20.3 vs 9.2% for milled, coarse and whole form, respectively; treatment × physical form interaction: P < 0.01). The N added to wet cereal kernels by the urea treatment was released in the rumen fermentation liquid more slowly than that simply added as urea before incubation. Based on solubility data, the treated whole or cracked kernels exhibited a slower N release than milled ones.","author":[{"family":"Nikulina","given":"A."},{"family":"Sarnataro","given":"C."},{"family":"Fabro","given":"C."},{"family":"Mason","given":"F."},{"family":"Spanghero","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"Nikulina2018","container-title":"Journal of Animal and Feed Sciences","DOI":"10.22358/jafs/90580/2018","ISSN":"1230-1388","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"173-178","title":"In vitro ammonia release of urea-treated high moisture barley and maize grain","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.22358/jafs/90580/2018","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"Nishino2003","abstract":"Aims: To assess the effects of inoculation of Lactobacillus buchneri on the ensiling properties and aerobic stability of maize silage. Methods and Results: Chopped whole crop maize was ensiled in 0.5 litre airtight polyethylene bottles (0.4 kg per bottle) and in double-layered, thin polyethylene bags (15 kg per bag), with or without inoculation of Lact. buchneri. The silos were stored for two to four months and the chemical composition, microbial numbers and aerobic stability were determined. Inoculation lowered lactic acid and yeasts, and increased acetic acid and pH value, resulting in improved aerobic stability of the silages. Inoculated silages produced 1,2-propanediol, the content of which increased as ensiling was prolonged, and nearly 50 g kg-1 dry matter had accumulated after four months of storage. The effects of inoculation, however, were much less pronounced in silages prepared in bags. Mannitol was found in all silages; the production was lowered by Lact. buchneri treatment and appeared to be unrelated to the accumulation of 1,2-propanediol. Conclusions: Inoculation of Lact. buchneri occasionally causes accumulation of 1,2-propanediol in silages without further degradation into propionic acid and 1-propanol. Significance and Impact of the Study: Substantial amounts of 1,2-propanediol could be consumed by ruminants when fed on silages inoculated with Lact. buchneri. In addition to increasing acetic acid, attention needs to be paid to 1,2-propanediol because the two fermentation products might affect the intake and utilization of silage-based diets.","author":[{"family":"Nishino","given":"Naoki"},{"family":"Yoshida","given":"M."},{"family":"Shiota","given":"H."},{"family":"Sakaguchi","given":"E."}],"citation-key":"Nishino2003","container-title":"Journal of Applied Microbiology","DOI":"10.1046/j.1365-2672.2003.01810.x","ISBN":"1364-5072 (Print)","ISSN":"13645072","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"page":"800-807","PMID":"12694444","title":"Accumulation of 1,2-propanediol and enhancement of aerobic stability in whole crop maize silage inoculated with Lactobacillus buchneri","type":"article-journal","volume":"94"},

It has been shown that haplotype-inference methods such as Clark's algorithm, the expectation-maximization algorithm, and a coalescence-based iterative-sampling algorithm are fairly effective and economical alternatives to molecular-haplotyping methods. To contend with some weaknesses of the existing algorithms, we propose a new Monte Carlo approach. In particular, we first partition the whole haplotype into smaller segments. Then, we use the Gibbs sampler both to construct the partial haplotypes of each segment and to assemble all the segments together. Our algorithm can accurately and rapidly infer haplotypes for a large number of linked SNPs. By using a wide variety of real and simulated data sets, we demonstrate the advantages of our Bayesian algorithm, and we show that it is robust to the violation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, to the presence of missing data, and to occurrences of recombination hotspots.","author":[{"family":"Niu","given":"Tianhua"},{"family":"Qin","given":"Zhaohui S"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Xiping"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jun S"}],"citation-key":"Niu2002","container-title":"American journal of human genetics","DOI":"10.1086/338446","ISSN":"0002-9297","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",1]]},"page":"157-69","PMID":"11741196","title":"Bayesian haplotype inference for multiple linked single-nucleotide polymorphisms.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=448439&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","volume":"70"},

In this study, 12 Holstein bulls in the fattening period (body weight = 485.0 ± 40.8 kg) were assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatments using a 4 × 4 Latin square design. Each experimental period consisted of a 17-d adaptation period and a 5-d collection period. The dietary treatments consisted of 4 proportions of WCWH (0, 33, 67, and 100%) as a substitute for LC (designated as WCWH0, WCWH33, WCWH67, and WCWH100, respectively). On d 18 and 22 of each experiment period, blood and rumen content samples were collected for analysis, respectively. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to analyze the rumen microbiomes. The results from this study revealed no differences in the saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acid proportions of rumen liquid among the treatments. It was observed in the present trial that rumen microbiotal flora were not significantly different in the bulls fed LC compared with the bulls fed WCWH. Additionally, blood sample analysis demonstrated that the concentration of urea nitrogen in the WCWH100 group was higher than that observed in the other groups. Meanwhile, no differences were detected for other serum parameters. There were no differences in the proportions of serum saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids among the treatments.

  {"id":"noftsger2003","abstract":"<h2>Abstract</h2><p>2-Hydroxy-4-(methylthio) butanoic acid (HMB) positively affects milk composition and yield, potentially through ruminal actions. Four continuous culture fermenters were used to determine the optimal concentration of HMB for digestibility of organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and hemicellulose and synthesis of microbial N. A highly degradable mix of hay and grain was used as a basal diet to simulate a typical lactation diet. Three concentrations of HMB (0, 0.055, and 0.110%) and one concentration of dl-Met (0.097%) were infused into the fermenters according to a 4×4 Latin square design. Digesta samples were collected during the last 3 d of each of the four 10-d experimental periods. Digestibility of OM, hemicellulose, and NDF was largely insensitive to treatment. Digestibility of ADF showed a quadratic effect to supplementation of HMB, with 0.055% having lower digestibility than 0 or 0.110%. Total production of VFA was not influenced by HMB supplementation, but differences in concentration and production of individual VFA were seen. Isobutyrate increased linearly with increasing HMB supplementation. Propionate concentration decreased linearly with increased HMB supplementation, but propionate production showed a quadratic trend (<i>P</i>=0.13). A higher concentration of acetate was detected for dl-Met compared with the highest HMB concentration. There were trends (<i>P</i><0.15) for dl-Met to decrease the production of isobutyrate and to lower the concentration of butyrate when compared with HMB. Microbial efficiency was not different among treatments. The proportion of bacterial N produced from NH<sub>3</sub>-N decreased linearly with increasing HMB, and bacteria receiving dl-Met synthesized more N from NH<sub>3</sub>-N than those receiving HMB. These data suggest that supplementation of HMB may have a sparing effect on branched chain volatile fatty acids because the fatty acids are not needed to provide carbon for synthesis of valine, isoleucine and leucine with ammonia. Comparisons of bacterial community structure in the fermenter effluent samples using PCR amplicons containing the ribosomal intergenic spacer region and its flanking partial 16S ribosomal RNA gene showed no distinct banding patterns, though treatments tended to group together.

  {"id":"Nonnecke2003","abstract":"The composition and functional capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear leukocyte populations from dairy cows are altered substantially during the peripartal period. These changes are associated with a heightened susceptibility of the mammary gland to infection. It has been postulated that the metabolic demands associated with lactogenesis may impact negatively leukocyte function during the periparturient period. In the present study, serum immunoglobulin G1 concentration and functional capacities of peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes from intact (n = 6) and mastectomized (n = 6) periparturient Jersey cows were evaluated and compared. Cell function assessments included lymphocyte proliferation, immunoglobulin M secretion, and interferon-gamma secretion by unstimulated and pokeweed mitogen stimulated mononuclear leukocytes. Data were summarized as mean responses for 5-d periods beginning 21 d prepartum and concluding at 19 d postpartum. The progressive decrease in serum immunoglobulin G in intact but not mastectomized cows before parturition likely was attributable to the selective uptake of this isotype by the mammary gland. Lymphocyte proliferation and secretion of interferon-gamma and polyclonal IgM by mitogen-stimulated leukocytes from intact cows decreased during the 15-d period before calving, reaching a nadir at 0 to 4 d postpartum. From 5 to 19 d postpartum, these functions often were comparable to those observed 2 to 3 wk prepartum. Functions of leukocytes from mastectomized cows did not change during the study period, although they often were of lower magnitude than those of cells from nonlactating cows. These results reconfirm the occurrence of a generalized reduction in blood mononuclear leukocyte function during the periparturient period. They also suggest that the reduction in leukocyte function during the period may be, in part, due to the physiologic demands imposed on the dairy cow by the lactating mammary gland.","author":[{"family":"Nonnecke","given":"B J"},{"family":"Kimura","given":"K"},{"family":"Goff","given":"J P"},{"family":"Kehrli","given":"M E"}],"citation-key":"Nonnecke2003","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(03)73829-6","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"page":"2359-68","PMID":"12906053","title":"Effects of the mammary gland on functional capacities of blood mononuclear leukocyte populations from periparturient cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030203738296/fulltext","volume":"86"},

  {"id":"Norman2009","abstract":"Reproductive information since 1995 from the USDA national dairy database was used to calculate yearly Holstein and Jersey means for days to first breeding after calving (DFB), 70-d nonreturn rate, conception rate (CR), number of breedings per lactation (NB), interval between first and last breedings during the lactation, days to last breeding after calving (DLB), pregnancy rate (PR), calving interval (CI), and interval between consecutive breedings. Data were from nearly 20 million breedings during >8 million lactations of >5 million cows in >23,000 herds. Means were also calculated for some traits by parity and breeding number for both breeds and by geographical region and synchronization status for Holsteins. The DFB declined for Holsteins from 92 d in 1996 to 85 d in 2007; the trend in yearly differences was not as consistent for Jerseys. First- and all-breeding 70-d nonreturn rate declined 5 to 9 percentage units over time. First- and all-breeding CR declined 2 to 4 percentage units. The DFB were longer for later parities of Holsteins than for early parities. Second- and third-breeding CR were sometimes 1 to 2 percentage units above first-breeding CR for Holsteins but lower (1 to 7 percentage units) for Jerseys. The CR within breeding number declined across parities for both breeds. The NB increased by 0.3 to 0.4 breedings over time but remained constant (2.5 or 2.6 breedings) across parities for Holsteins and increased (from 2.2 to 2.4 breedings) for Jerseys. Holstein DFB were fewest in the Northwest (78 d) and greatest in the Mountain region (92 d). Regional CR was highest for the Northeast and Southwest (33%) and lowest for the Southeast (26%); NB was fewest for the Northeast (2.3) and greatest for the Southeast (2.7). Mean DLB was fewest for the Southwest (127 d) and greatest for the Mountain region (157 d); CI was shortest for the Southwest (406 d) and longest for the Mideast (434 d). Mean PR was highest for the Southwest (28.3%) and lowest for the Mideast and Southeast (22.2%). Use of timed artificial insemination following synchronized estrus appears to have reduced DFB, lowered CR, and increased NB while reducing DLB and CI. However, synchronized breeding was not a primary cause of Holstein regional differences for reproductive traits. Since 2002, phenotypic performance for CR, DLB, and CI as well as genetic merit for daughter PR have stopped their historical declines and started to improve.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Norman","given":"H D"},{"family":"Wright","given":"J R"},{"family":"Hubbard","given":"S M"},{"family":"Miller","given":"R H"},{"family":"Hutchison","given":"J L"}],"citation-key":"Norman2009","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2008-1768","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",7]]},"page":"3517-28","PMID":"19528630","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Reproductive status of Holstein and Jersey cows in the United States.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19528630","volume":"92"},

Sugars are water-soluble carbohydrates that are readily available in the rumen. Although sugars ferment faster than starch or fibre in the rumen, the rates of disaccharide hydrolysis and monosaccharide fermentation vary greatly depending on the type of sugar and rumen environment. Despite rapid fermentation in the rumen and their potential to provide greater fermentable energy to enhance microbial protein production, feeding sugars in place of dietary starch sources may not decrease rumen pH or improve N utilization efficiency and milk protein production in dairy cows. However, feeding high-sugar diets often increases dry matter intake, butyrate concentration in the rumen, and milk fat yield. These nutritional characteristics of sugars may allow us to use high-sugar feedstuffs as an alternative energy source for lactating dairy cows to increase dietary energy density with reduced risk of rumen acidosis, but there is little evidence in the literature to indicate that the synchrony of rumen fermentation would be enhanced by feeding high-sugar diets with high soluble protein. Greater butyrate production from feeding high-sugar diets is expected to enhance proliferation of gut tissues, but its physiological mechanisms and effects of butyrate metabolism on overall productivity of dairy cows warrant further investigations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Oba","given":"Masahito"}],"citation-key":"oba2011","container-title":"Canadian Journal of Animal Science","container-title-short":"Can.

  {"id":"oba2022","abstract":"Carbohydrates are the primary energy source for lactating dairy cows, and dairy diets are usually formulated for certain concentrations of forage neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and starch due to their direct effects on dry matter intake and milk production. Forage NDF exerts greater filling effects in the rumen than other dietary components and can limit maximum voluntary feed intake of lactating dairy cows. Since an analytical method for NDF was developed more than a half century ago, it has been used widely to characterize forages and diets for dairy cows. However, because NDF is a chemical measurement varying in its digestibility, in vitro digestibility measurements were developed as a biological approach to assess forage quality. Research efforts over the last several decades led to the development of forage cultivars or hybrids with enhanced in vitro NDF digestibility, such as brown midrib, and management practices considering differences in NDF digestibility of forages. In addition, in vitro NDF digestibility and undigested NDF are commonly measured in commercial labs, and estimated rates of digestion are used in dynamic models in an effort to improve the accuracy and precision of diet formulation. Starch digestion in the rumen also varies among starch sources, being affected by grain type, extent of processing, and conservation method. The site and rate of starch digestion affect dry matter intake and nutrient partitioning in dairy cows by modifying temporal supply of fuel. In addition, dietary starch content and its fermentability can affect digestion rates of starch itself and NDF in the rumen. Previous research has increased our understanding of dietary carbohydrates, but its application for diet formulations requires integrated approaches accounting for factors affecting the filling effects of forage NDF, starch digestion, and temporal fuel supply.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Oba","given":"M."},{"family":"Kammes-Main","given":"K."}],"citation-key":"oba2022","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2022-22420","ISSN":"00220302","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11]]},"language":"en","page":"S0022030222006506","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Symposium review: Effects of carbohydrate digestion on feed intake and fuel supply","title-short":"Symposium review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030222006506"},

During negative net energy balance (EBAL), it appears that moderate CLA-induced milk fat depression causes a positive response in milk yield; however, as milk fat depression becomes more severe, the milk yield response diminishes. Multiparous Holstein cows (n = 31) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments beginning 9 +/- 6 d before expected calving and ceased at 40 d in milk (DIM): 1) 578 g/d of a rumen-inert (RI) palm fatty acid distillate (control), 2) 600 g/d of RI-CLA for the entire trial period (CLA-1), and 3) 600 g/d of RI-CLA until 10 DIM followed by 200 g/d for the remainder of the trial (CLA-2). Each dose provided equal amounts of fatty acids by replacing and balancing each treatment with a RI palm fatty acid distillate. Doses provided a total of 522 g of fatty acids/ d and 0, 174, or 58 (depending upon DIM) g of CLA (mixed isomers)/d. To improve palatability, doses were mixed with 600 g/d of dried molasses; one-half of the supplement was fed at 0800 h, and the remainder at 1900 h. Individual milk yield, dry matter intake, and body weight were recorded daily and milk composition determined every other day. There was no overall CLA effect on either the content or yield of milk protein or lactose. Both CLA treatments decreased overall milk fat content (26.0 and 18.3%) and yield (22.5 and 17.3%) with CLA-induced milk fat depression becoming significant by d 8. The CLA-induced milk fat depression increased in magnitude with progressing DIM until reaching a plateau on d 18 for CLA-1 (43%) and on d 14 for CLA-2 (33%), although neither milk fat trans-10, cis-12 CLA content (1.8 mg/g) nor its transfer efficiency (6.3%) changed over time. Treatments had no effect on overall dry matter intake or milk yield, but there was a treatment x time interaction for milk production, as cows fed either CLA treatment had increased milk yield after the second week of lactation. Cows fed either CLA treatment had a significant improvement in overall EBAL (-5.1 vs. -1.8 Mcal/d), a decrease in nonesterified fatty acid levels (12%), and an increase in glucose levels (11%).

  {"id":"Oetzel2012","abstract":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of supplementation with oral Ca boluses after calving on early-lactation health and milk yield. Cows in their second lactation or greater (n=927) from 2 large dairies in Wisconsin were enrolled during the summer of 2010. Both herds were fed supplemental anions during the prefresh period and less than 1% of fresh cows were treated for clinical milk fever. Cows were scored before calving for lameness and body condition, and then randomly assigned to either a control group or an oral Ca bolus-supplemented group. Control cows received no oral Ca boluses around calving. Cows in the oral Ca bolus group received 2 oral Ca boluses (Bovikalc, Boehringer Ingelheim, St. Joseph, MO), one bolus 0 to 2h after calving and the second 8 to 35 h after calving. The oral Ca bolus administration schedule allowed fresh cows to be restrained in headlocks only once daily. Whole-blood samples were collected immediately before the second oral Ca bolus was given and were analyzed for ionized Ca (Ca(2+)) concentration. Early-lactation health events were recorded and summed for each cow. Only 6 cases (0.6% of calvings) of clinical milk fever occurred during the trial, and only 14% of cows tested were hypocalcemic (Ca(2+) less than 1.0 mmol/L) at 8 to 35 h after calving. Mean Ca(2+) concentrations were not different between the control and oral Ca bolus-supplemented groups. Blood samples from the cows given oral Ca boluses were collected an average of 20.6 h after administration of the first bolus. Subpopulations of cows with significant responses to oral Ca bolus supplementation were identified based on significant interactions between oral Ca bolus supplementation and covariates in mixed multiple regression models. Lame cows supplemented with oral Ca boluses averaged 0.34 fewer health events in the first 30 d in milk compared with lame cows that were not supplemented with oral Ca boluses. Cows with a higher previous lactation mature-equivalent milk production (greater than 105% of herd rank) and supplemented with oral Ca boluses produced 2.9 kg more milk at their first test after calving compared with cows with higher previous lactation milk yields that were not supplemented. Results of this study indicate that lame cows and higher producing cows responded favorably to supplementation with oral Ca boluses. Supplementing targeted subpopulations of cows with oral Ca boluses was beneficial even for dairies with a very low incidence of hypocalcemia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Oetzel","given":"G R"},{"family":"Miller","given":"B E"}],"citation-key":"Oetzel2012","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5510","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",10,3]]},"page":"7051-7065","PMID":"23040027","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of oral calcium bolus supplementation on early-lactation health and milk yield in commercial dairy herds.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23040027","volume":"95"},

Although in vitro studies showed a detoxification capacity of PA in sheep, few field data are available on the ability of grazing sheep to cope with ragwort. During two grazing seasons on a ragwort-rich pasture, we studied: (1) To what extent do sheep voluntarily ingest ragwort and (2) What impact their grazing behavior has on animal health. Ragwort intake was monitored by counting missing plant parts and calculating their weight. From 70 sheep, seven were slaughtered at the beginning and in six-week intervals at the end of each grazing period to monitor blood parameters and liver tissue. Sheep continuously preferred ragwort. The daily intake was above the currently assumed lethal dose, varying between 0.2–4.9 kg per sheep. Clinical, hematologic, and blood biochemistry parameters mostly remained within the reference limits. Initially elevated liver copper content declined over time. The liver of all 70 animals displayed slight to moderate hepatitis, fibrosis, and proliferation of the bile ducts, but no morphological signs of liver cirrhosis. Sheep preferred and tolerated ragwort, making their grazing an option to control ragwort from both an animal health and nature conservation perspective.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Ohlsen","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Ganter","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Wohlsein","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Reckels","given":"Bernd"},{"family":"Huckauf","given":"Aiko"},{"family":"Lenzewski","given":"Nikola"},{"family":"Aboling","given":"Sabine"}],"citation-key":"ohlsen2022","container-title":"Animals","DOI":"10.3390/ani12101289","ISSN":"2076-2615","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"10","page":"1289","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Grazing Ecology of Sheep and Its Impact on Vegetation and Animal Health on Pastures Dominated by Common Ragwort (Senecio jacobaea L.)—Part 2: Animal Health","title-short":"Grazing Ecology of Sheep and Its Impact on Vegetation and Animal Health on Pastures Dominated by Common Ragwort (Senecio jacobaea L.)—Part 2","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/12/10/1289","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"Okkema2021","abstract":"Physiological udder edema is a noninfectious metabolic disorder in dairy cattle, which may be present in a high percentage of dairy cows. This review summarizes the factors associated with udder edema. They include genetics, nutrition, oxidative stress, and physiological changes in freshening heifers. Udder edema negatively affects the productive life of a dairy cow. Udder support structures may be broken down due to tissue damage. Swollen teats may become sensitive, which makes attaching the milking unit more difficult. The amount of milk produced is decreased due to fluid buildup in the tissue spaces. Risk of secondary diseases, such as mastitis or udder cleft dermatitis, is also increased. All of these elements have an economic impact on the dairy farmer, in both the short term and the long term. If severe, damage could lead to early culling. Some possible methods for managing udder edema include (1) providing a separate diet for late-gestation heifers to monitor anionic salt intake, (2) selecting for either genetic lines with lower milk production or a phenotypic reduction of udder edema, and (3) ensuring that adequate exogenous antioxidants, such as vitamin E, vitamin C, carotenoids, and flavonoids, are provided in the diet to mitigate oxidative stress. In conclusion, udder edema may be an emerging issue that has the potential to seriously affect dairy cow welfare. Many of the research studies are outdated, and research with modern dairy cows is needed. The development of a scientifically validated udder edema scoring system is also needed to assess the severity of udder edema.","author":[{"family":"Okkema","given":"Cora"},{"family":"Grandin","given":"Temple"}],"citation-key":"Okkema2021","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2020-19353","ISSN":"15253198","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Graduate Student Literature Review: Udder edema in dairy cattle—A possible emerging animal welfare issue","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2020-19353"},
  {"id":"Olagaray2019","abstract":"Systemic inflammation is common in early lactation dairy cows and is associated with decreased milk production. The Scutellaria baicalensis plant contains flavonoids with antiinflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, which may counteract the inflammatory state in early lactation dairy cows. The objective of this experiment was to determine whether Scutellaria baicalensis extract (SBE), a source of bioactive flavonoids, would alter the adaptation to lactation. Multiparous Holstein cows (n = 122) were used in a randomized block design to determine the effect of short-term and long-term postpartum administration of SBE on 305-d milk yield, 120-d milk component yield, and early lactation milk markers of inflammation and metabolic function. Treatments were 1) control, 2) short term (5-d) administration of the SBE (SBE5), and 3) long term (60-d) administration of the SBE (SBE60). Treatments were included in a treatment pellet that was identical to a control pellet in ingredient source and composition except for the extract (10 g/d SBE providing 3.3 g/d of the flavonoid baicalin), both provided via an automated milking system beginning on d 1 of lactation. Milk samples were collected on d 1, 3, and once during d 5–12 of lactation, followed by weekly sampling until 120 days in milk (DIM). Milk samples collected in the first 2 wk were used for biomarker analysis (haptoglobin, β-hydroxybutyrate [BHB], and glucose-6-phosphate [G6P]), and all samples were used for composition analysis. Cows were body condition scored every 2 wk prepartum and postpartum. Milk production, programmed pellet allocation, and actual provision of both pelleted feeds were recorded daily. Treatment effects were evaluated by contrasts between control and SBE5 and control and SBE60 for both the treatment (TP; wk 1–9) and carryover periods (CP; wk 10–37). Total pellet offered was greater for SBE60 in both the TP (P < 0.01) and CP (P = 0.02) but was not different for SBE5 during either period (P 0.13). No treatment effects were observed for body condition score (BCS), milk haptoglobin, BHB, or G6P. SBE5 did not alter milk yield or milk components. SBE60 increased whole-lactation milk yield by 1,419 kg (13%; P = 0.03). SBE60 increased milk lactose and fat yields (P 0.04) and tended to increase milk protein yield (P = 0.09) during TP, and each increased during CP (P 0.04). Somatic cell count decreased by 10% in SBE60 during TP (P = 0.02) but not CP (P = 0.13). Mastitis incidence tended to differ by treatment, being lesser for both SBE5 and SBE60 vs. control (14 and 15% vs. 33%). SBE supplementation did not impact time to pregnancy or hazard of leaving the herd. In conclusion, despite no detected treatment effects on BCS or milk biomarkers of inflammation and metabolic status, supplementation of postpartum dairy cows with Scutellaria baicalensis extract for 60 d was effective at increasing whole lactation milk yield.","author":[{"family":"Olagaray","given":"K.

With farms increasing in size and an increase in the number of rotary milking parlors, the need for automation of postmilking teat disinfection is mounting. Automated teat dipping and backflushing (ADB) systems have existed for some years, but their effect on udder health was never examined in a field study on commercial dairy farms. The objectives of this study were, therefore, to evaluate the effect of introducing an ADB system in a herd on (1) bulk milk somatic cell count (SCC), (2) individual cow SCC, and (3) the proportion of newly elevated SCC. Dairy herd improvement data were collected over a 30-mo period on 25 sets of 3 farms. Each set of 3 farms contained a farm that installed an ADB system, one that disinfected teats using dipping after milking, and one that sprayed teats after milking. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models. Bulk milk SCC on farms that sprayed or dipped before installing an ADB system were 16,000 and 30,000 cells/mL lower in the period 6 to 18 mo after installation, respectively, than on farms that continued spraying or dipping the teats after milking. In the same period after installing an ADB system, proportions of cows with elevated SCC were 4.3 and 1.2% lower, respectively, compared with spraying and with dipping. Similarly, proportions of cows that had newly elevated SCC were 1.5% lower and 0.3% higher, respectively, compared with farms that sprayed or dipped. Installing an ADB system had a beneficial effect on bulk milk SCC, individual cow SCC, and the proportion of newly elevated SCC. The effect was most prominent in the period 6 to 18 mo after installation of an ADB system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Olde Riekerink","given":"R G M"},{"family":"Ohnstad","given":"I"},{"family":"Santen","given":"B","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Barkema","given":"H W"}],"citation-key":"OldeRiekerink2012","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2011-4939","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",9]]},"page":"4931-8","PMID":"22916897","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of an automated dipping and backflushing system on somatic cell counts.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22916897","volume":"95"},

The objectives of this study were to define a clinical scoring system for UCD, estimate the within-herd prevalence of UCD, and identify potential risk factors of UCD at cow and herd level. On 20 randomly selected dairy farms in the Netherlands, each lactating cow was photographed from a ventral, lateral, and caudal position. A scoring system with 6 categories of severity of UCD was proposed based on the ventral photographs. Cow measures such as udder width and depth, and front quarter attachment were determined from the lateral and caudal photographs. A questionnaire was conducted on each farm during farm visits. Udder cleft dermatitis, defined as a score 3 or higher, was detected in 5.2% of the 948 cows involved in this study. Within-herd prevalences of UCD ranged between 0 and 15% and UCD was found in 16 (80%) of the participating farms. Cows with a deep udder (relative to the hock), large front quarters, and a small angle between udder and abdominal wall were more likely to develop UCD. Production level and use of a footbath were identified as being positively associated with herd-level UCD prevalence. Herd size and average bulk milk somatic cell count did not seem to be associated with UCD prevalence. Because of the small herd sample size, no firm conclusions were drawn on herd-level risk factors. However, results from this study can be used in designing a future longitudinal UCD study. The prevalences of UCD found in the present study illustrate the current UCD situation in the Netherlands. Our results demonstrate that multiple potential risk factors of UCD could be identified at both the cow and herd level.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Olde Riekerink","given":"RGM"},{"family":"Amersfort","given":"K","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Sampimon","given":"Oc"},{"family":"Hooijer","given":"Ga"},{"family":"Lam","given":"TJGM"}],"citation-key":"olderiekerinkShortCommunicationPrevalence2014","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2013-7651","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"5007-5011","title":"Short communication: Prevalence, risk factors, and a field scoring system for udder cleft dermatitis in Dutch dairy herds","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/","volume":"97"},
  {"id":"olentsova2020","abstract":"Diarrhea of newborn calves is a globally common disease that causes significant damage to livestock. Economic losses from diarrhea in young cattle are directly related to the cost of long-term treatment of animals and their mortality, as well as the projected decrease in productivity, which negatively affects the efficiency of maintaining the entire herd. Currently, it is an established fact that diarrhea of newborn calves has a polyethological nature, which has an interaction in pathogenesis between the calf's body, enteropathogens and the technology of keeping animals. For the treatment of calves with diarrhea caused by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, many methods and schemes using various antibiotics have been proposed. The need for fast and efficient treatment for acute diarrhea of calves in many cases leads to an empirical selection of the drug without taking into account the spectrum of its activity. This approach leads to the appearance and rapid spread of antibiotic resistant strains of microorganisms and as a result reduces the effectiveness of veterinary measures. The article presents the results of a study of the effect of a new complex drug containing stabilized silver particles, an immunostimulator and an antioxidant on the body of calves with diarrhea, as an alternative to the antibiotics. Studies were conducted on calves of the first week of life with a diagnosis of diarrhea, with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli confirmation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Olentsova","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Orobets","given":"Vladimir"},{"family":"Sevostyanova","given":"Olga"},{"family":"Kireev","given":"Ivan"},{"family":"Agarkov","given":"Alexander"}],"citation-key":"olentsova2020","container-title":"E3S Web of Conferences","container-title-short":"E3S Web Conf.","DOI":"10.1051/e3sconf/202020301026","editor":[{"family":"Muratov","given":"A."},{"family":"Ignatieva","given":"S."}],"ISSN":"2267-1242","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"01026","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Silver-based drug effect on the body of calves with diarrhea","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.e3s-conferences.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202020301026","volume":"203"},

  {"id":"Oliveira2017","abstract":"Forages are usually inoculated with homofermentative and facultative heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to enhance lactic acid fermentation of forages, but effects of such inoculants on silage quality and the performance of dairy cows are unclear. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to examine the effects of LAB inoculation on silage quality and preservation and the performance of dairy cows. A second objective was to examine the factors affecting the response to silage inoculation with LAB. The studies that met the selection criteria included 130 articles that examined the effects of LAB inoculation on silage quality and 31 articles that investigated dairy cow performance responses. The magnitude of the effect (effect size) was evaluated using raw mean differences (RMD) between inoculated and uninoculated treatments. Heterogeneity was explored by meta-regression and subgroup analysis using forage type, LAB species, LAB application rate, and silo scale (laboratory or farm-scale) as covariates for the silage quality response and forage type, LAB species, diet type [total mixed ration (TMR) or non-TMR], and the level of milk yield of the control cows as covariates for the performance responses. Inoculation with LAB (≥105 cfu/g as fed) markedly increased silage fermentation and dry matter recovery in temperate and tropical grasses, alfalfa, and other legumes. However, inoculation did not improve the fermentation of corn, sorghum, or sugarcane silages. Inoculation with LAB reduced clostridia and mold growth, butyric acid production, and ammonia-nitrogen in all silages, but it had no effect on aerobic stability. Silage inoculation (≥105 cfu/g as fed) increased milk yield and the response had low heterogeneity. However, inoculation had no effect on diet digestibility and feed efficiency. Inoculation with LAB improved the fermentation of grass and legume silages and the performance of dairy cows but did not affect the fermentation of corn, sorghum, and sugar cane silages or the aerobic stability of any silage. Further research is needed to elucidate how silage inoculated with homofermentative and facultative heterofermentative LAB improves the performance of dairy cows.","author":[{"family":"Oliveira","given":"André S."},{"family":"Weinberg","given":"Zwi G."},{"family":"Ogunade","given":"Ibukun M."},{"family":"Cervantes","given":"Andres A.P."},{"family":"Arriola","given":"Kathy G."},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Donghyeon"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xujiao"},{"family":"Gonçalves","given":"Mariana C.M."},{"family":"Vyas","given":"Diwakar"},{"family":"Adesogan","given":"Adegbola T."}],"citation-key":"Oliveira2017","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2016-11815","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"4587-4603","PMID":"28342607","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Meta-analysis of effects of inoculation with homofermentative and facultative heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria on silage fermentation, aerobic stability, and the performance of dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030217302515","volume":"100"},

  {"id":"Orsel2018","abstract":"© 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH Since the first report of bovine digital dermatitis (DD) in 1974, there is a large body of the literature published; however, effective prevention and control of the disease remain elusive. Although many aspects of the pathogenesis of DD have been investigated, even some of the most basic questions such as the aetiology of this disease remain under debate. Treponema spp. have been strongly associated with DD lesions and occur in abundance in advanced lesions; however, efforts to induce disease with pure cultures of these organisms have been largely underwhelming and inconsistent. Furthermore, although the disease has been presented for several decades, there is limited scientific evidence regarding effective treatment of DD. Apparent discrepancies between effectiveness in vitro and in vivo have challenged the scientific community to identify new potential treatment options. With no treatment resulting in a 100% cure rate, the current expectation is manageable control, but prospects for the eradication of the disease are unlikely using current approaches. In order to develop more effective approaches to control DD on-farm, there is a critical need for a deeper understanding regarding the causation, ecology, transmission and treatment of this disease. In this article, we attempt to provide insights into specific research needs related to DD in order to assist the industry, researchers, pharmaceutical companies and research sponsors with decision-making and identified research gaps.","author":[{"family":"Orsel","given":"K."},{"family":"Plummer","given":"P."},{"family":"Shearer","given":"J."},{"family":"De Buck","given":"J."},{"family":"Carter","given":"S.

Liver tissue was collected on -10, 7, and 21 d, and blood samples more frequently, from -21 through 21 d. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with the preplanned contrasts CON versus SM + MS and SM versus MS. No differences in prepartal DM intake (DMI) or body condition score were observed. After calving, body condition score was lower (2.6 vs. 2.8), whereas DMI was greater (15.4 vs. 13.3. kg/d) for Met-supplemented cows. Postpartal diet × time interactions were observed for milk fat percentage, milk fat yield, energy-corrected milk:DMI ratio, and energy balance. These were mainly due to changes among time points across all treatments. Cows supplemented with either Met source increased milk yield, milk protein percentage, energy-corrected milk, and milk fat yield by 3.4. kg/d, 0.18% units, 3.9. kg/d, and 0.18. kg/d, respectively. Those responses were associated with greater postpartum concentration of growth hormone but not insulin-like growth factor 1. There was a diet × time effect for nonesterified fatty acid concentration due to greater values on d 7 for MS; however, liver concentration of triacylglycerol was not affected by diet or diet × time but increased postpartum. Blood neutrophil phagocytosis at 21 d was greater with Met supplementation, suggesting better immune function. Supplemental MS or SM resulted in a tendency for lower incidence of ketosis postpartum. Although supplemental MS or SM did not decrease liver triacylglycerol, it improved milk production-related traits by enhancing voluntary DMI. © 2013 American Dairy Science Association.","author":[{"family":"Osorio","given":"J.

  {"id":"otwinowska-mindur2025","abstract":"Precise genetic parameter estimates can allow the breeding value evaluation to be adjusted to meet European requirements and to enable participation in the international evaluation of Simmental bulls conducted by Interbull. Genetic parameters were estimated for a multitrait multilactation random regression test-day model for milk in Simmental cattle in Poland. Data came from the official Polish national recording system. Records of 6 447 Simmental cows born from 2002 through 2021 in 1 046 herds were collected. The cows were daughters of 987 sires and 4 590 dams. A minimum of two daughters per sire was required. Daily yields were collected between 5 and 305 days in milk. The BLUPf90 package and a Bayesian method via Gibbs sampling were used to estimate (co)variance components. The model contained fixed herd-test-date effect, fixed regressions within age-season of calving classes, and random additive genetic and permanent environmental regressions. The Wilmink function was used for fixed regressions, and third-order Legendre polynomials for random regressions. The mean heritability for daily milk yields and milk composition ranged from 0.12 (somatic cell score) to 0.41 (protein content in milk). The majority of the analysed traits were most heritable at the end of 305-d lactation. Genetic correlations between daily milk, fat, protein and lactose yields were positive and high (0.78–0.99). This meant that selection for one of those milk traits indirectly induced a similar response in another milk trait. The lactational heritabilities of all nine traits were much higher than the estimates of average daily heritabilities, and varied from 0.29 for somatic cell score to 0.74 for urea content in milk. For both daily and lactational parameters, traits expressed in percent were more highly heritable than yield traits. The values of the genetic parameters estimated in this paper can be used when a single-trait multilactation random regression test-day animal model for production traits is applied in the official genetic evaluation of the Simmental population, replacing the current lactation model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Otwinowska-Mindur","given":"A."},{"family":"Ptak","given":"E."},{"family":"Jagusiak","given":"W."},{"family":"Zarnecki","given":"A."}],"citation-key":"otwinowska-mindur2025","container-title":"animal","container-title-short":"animal","DOI":"10.1016/j.animal.2024.101395","ISSN":"1751-7311","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,1]]},"page":"101395","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Genetic parameters for milk production traits of Simmental cows with random regression test-day model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175173112400332X","volume":"19"},

Four video cameras were placed in a free-stall pen containing 144 stalls and 129 high producing cows. The videos were recorded over a 6-d period in July 1999 and then were reviewed using 60-min scan sampling techniques. Cows were counted as lying, standing in alley without eating, standing in free stalls, or eating in each of the four sections of the pen. Temperature probes were placed on the feedline, free stalls, on both ends of the pen, and at an outside location. Relationships between proportion eligible lying and ambient temperature, feeding time, and time since milking were examined. Proportion eligible lying was equal to number of cows lying divided by total number of cows lying or standing but not eating. Cattle showed a significant pattern of temporal cyclicity in their lying behavior, with the highest average proportion of eligible cows lying at 6:00 a.m. (85%) and the lowest at 9:00 p.m. (53%). Increasing environmental temperatures and time elapsed since milking negatively impacted proportion of eligible cows observed lying when evaluated using 60-min scan sampling techniques.","author":[{"family":"Overton","given":"M.W."},{"family":"Sischo","given":"W.M."},{"family":"Temple","given":"G.D."},{"family":"Moore","given":"D.A."}],"citation-key":"Overton2002","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(02)74323-3","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"page":"2407-2413","PMID":"12362476","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Using Time-Lapse Video Photography to Assess Dairy Cattle Lying Behavior in a Free-Stall Barn","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030202743233","volume":"85"},

Data were extracted from nine experiments involving 532 bovines, 259 of which received CU and 273 who received SRU. When preparing the database, the applied sample unit was the average response for each article. Data from peer-reviewed articles published in indexed journals including the finishing phase of feedlot feeding were used. Furthermore, only studies applying conventional urea as a control group tested against slow-release urea and reporting the mean and variability of dry matter intake (DMI), average daily gain (ADG), feed conversion (FC), hot carcass weight (HCW) and subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT) were included in the meta-analysis. The effect size for all parameters was calculated as mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval and heterogeneity determined by the Q test and I2 statistics. A meta-analysis of random effects was conducted when I2 > 50% and fixed effects with I2 < 50% for each indicator separately with the means of control and experimental group. DMI (P = 0.6733), ADG (P = 0.1512) and FC (P = 0.1599) were similar between steers that received slow-release or conventional urea in feedlots. This similarity also extended to HCW (P = 0.1701) and SFT (P = 0.2709). The replacement of conventional urea with slow-release urea in the diet of steers finished in feedlot does not result in differences in performance and carcass traits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Pacheco","given":"Rangel Fernandes"},{"family":"Machado","given":"Diego Soares"},{"family":"Viana","given":"Alexandra Fabielle Pereira"},{"family":"Teixeira","given":"Jullia Sehorek"},{"family":"Milani","given":"Lucas"}],"citation-key":"Pacheco2021","container-title":"Livestock Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.livsci.2021.104549","ISSN":"18711413","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,16]]},"page":"104549","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Comparison of the effects of slow-release urea vs conventional urea supplementation on some finishing cattle parameters: A meta-analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1871141321001578"},

  {"id":"palladinoDailyFecalPH2022","abstract":"Evidence supports a causal link between anomalous intestinal function and impaired performance in dairy cows. Consequently, digesta pH values obtained from colon, cecum, and rectum are increasingly used to monitor intestinal function in dairy cows. We conducted a study to describe the daily dynamics of fecal pH in lactating dairy cows. The study lasted 4 d and individual records of dry matter intake, milk yield, and fecal pH were taken. Samples of feces were taken every 4 h during the 4-d study, and sampling time was adjusted ahead by 1 h daily so that a sample was obtained for each 1-h interval of the day. Data were analyzed using a mixed-effect model including time as fixed effect and cow as a random factor. We performed a cosinor analysis using pH data at different time points to determine whether fecal pH followed a biorhythmic pattern. On average, cows consumed 19.1 ± 1.55 kg/d of dry matter and produced 26.3 ± 4.16 kg/d of milk. The most relevant results confirmed a biorhythmic pattern for feces pH around feeding time: mesor (midline estimating statistic of rhythm) 6.20, amplitude 0.28, and acrophase 5.66. Additionally, we found a positive relationship between dry matter intake and amplitude, possibly because of an increase in the amount of fermentable carbohydrate reaching the hindgut in response to increasing intake. When using fecal pH as an indicator of intestinal function, it is critical to obtain samples at several time points to capture its daily rhythmicity and to report sampling time relative to feeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Palladino","given":"Rafael Alejandro"},{"family":"Olmeda","given":"María Florencia"},{"family":"Juliano","given":"Nicolás"},{"family":"Bargo","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Ipharraguerre","given":"Ignacio R."}],"citation-key":"palladinoDailyFecalPH2022","container-title":"JDS Communications","DOI":"10.3168/JDSC.2021-0158","ISSN":"2666-9102","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,1]]},"page":"106-109","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Daily fecal pH pattern and variation in lactating dairy cows","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},

Rumen microbiota through rumen fermentation produces as major end products volatile fatty acids that provide animal’s energy requirements, and microbial CP. Diet is a key factor that can manipulate rumen microbiota, and each variation of the physical and chemical composition creates a specific niche that selects specific microbes. Alteration in the chemical composition of forage, the addition of concentrates in the diet, or the inclusion of plant extract and probiotics, can induce a change in rumen microbiota. High-throughput sequencing technologies are the approaches utilised to investigate the microbial system. Also, the application of omics technologies allows us to understand rumen microbiota composition and these approaches are useful to improve selection programmes. The aim of this review was to summarise the knowledge about rumen microbiota, its role in nutrient metabolism, and how diet can influence its composition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Palmonari","given":"A."},{"family":"Federiconi","given":"A."},{"family":"Formigoni","given":"A."}],"citation-key":"palmonari2024","container-title":"animal","container-title-short":"animal","DOI":"10.1016/j.animal.2024.101319","ISSN":"1751-7311","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,1]]},"page":"101319","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Animal board invited review: The effect of diet on rumen microbial composition in dairy cows","title-short":"Animal board invited review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751731124002568","volume":"18"},

Experiment 1 was a preliminary trial in which six Jersey cows were in two 3 x 3 Latin squares to evaluate two formulations of calcium soap at two intake levels (500 and 1000 g/d). The two formulations were compared with control (0 supplement) within squares; the squares differed in amount of soap supplemented. Mean apparent digestibilities of fat were not influenced by source or amount of fat supplemented and averaged 82.5, 84.3, and 83.4% for control, 500, and 1000 g/d. In Experiment 2, six Jersey cows were in a 6 x 6 Latin square to compare effects of various commercial fats on digestibility of diet components at 2.85 and 5.7% (DM) added fat. Higher fat decreased digestibility of P and fatty acid. Fatty acid intake affected fatty acid digestibility quadratically, and variability among cows increased at higher fatty acid intake. Endogenous fecal fat was 55.9 g/d; apparent digestibility of fat was relatively constant at 80 to 82% between 2 and 5% of diet DM, whereas marginal true digestibility decreased linearly (4.4% units/100 g fatty acid consumed).

  {"id":"Palmquist1993","abstract":"Genetic selection for increased milk fat percentage leads to increased proportions of short-chain fatty acids in milk fat and decreased proportions of long-chain fatty acids. Milk fat composition is strongly influenced by stage of lactation; proportion of short chains (de novo synthesis) is low initially and increases until at least 8 to 10 wk into lactation. Milk fat composition is changed more by the amount and composition of dietary fat than any other dietary component. Seasonal and regional differences in milk fat composition are measurable, most likely because of local differences in feed supplies. Milk fat composition can be modified readily by changing the feeding regimen. The most significant changes in milk fat quality relate to rheological (melting) properties, which influence numerous aspects of character and quality of manufactured dairy products. Dietary fat fed to change milk fat composition may also influence contents of protein, urea, citrate, and soluble calcium in milk and influence oxidative stability and flavor. It is important for both dairy nutritionists and dairy food chemists to understand the consequences of feeding programs on milk quality.","author":[{"family":"Palmquist","given":"D L"},{"family":"Beaulieu","given":"a D"},{"family":"Barbano","given":"D M"}],"citation-key":"Palmquist1993","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993",6]]},"page":"1753-71","PMID":"8326036","title":"Feed and animal factors influencing milk fat composition.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8326036","volume":"76"},

Experimental challenge procedures resulted in consistent reductions for predipping compared with no udder preparation and conventional udder preparation, indicating a potential for effectiveness. Challenge studies that included the treatments of predip only and postdip only indicated that interactions during the milking process require elucidation. Positive benefits have been observed for predipping in field trials among some herds, but wide variation has been observed between herds in all field trial evaluations. Parity, DIM, and season of the year had major interactions on efficacy of predipping in Pankey et al's 1987 report; other trials have been of shorter duration and precluded analysis of these interactions. Interactions among these variables influenced incidence of mastitis by environmental pathogens. The length of time after milking before teats are contaminated probably is a major influence on predip efficacy. Predipping has reduced incidence of new IMIs and new cases of clinical mastitis. Unfortunately, certain factors negated these positive effects. These factors need to be defined. Producers should monitor effects of predipping to determine whether the investment in product and time has an economic return under the conditions of their dairy.","author":[{"family":"Pankey","given":"J.

  {"id":"Pappritz2011","abstract":"The supplementation of conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) to the rations of dairy cows represents an opportunity to reduce the content of milk fat. Therefore, CLA have the potential beneficial effect of reducing energy requirements of the early lactating cow. The present study aimed at the examination of long-term and posttreatment effects of dietary CLA intake on performance, variables of energy metabolism-like plasma levels of non esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and fatty acid profile in milk fat. Forty-six pregnant German Holstein cows were assigned to one of three dietary treatments: (1) 100 g/ d of control fat supplement (CON), (2) 50 g/d of control fat supplement and 50 g/ d of CLA supplement (CLA-1) and (3) 100 g/d of CLA supplement (CLA-2). The lipid-encapsulated CLA supplement consisted of approximately 10% of trans-10, cis-12 CLA and cis-9, trans-11 CLA each. The experiment started 1 d after calving and continued for about 38 weeks, divided into a supplementation (26 weeks) and a depletion period (12 weeks). Over the first 7 weeks of treatment, 11 and 16% reductions in dry matter intake compared to control were observed for the cows fed CLA-1 and CLA-2 supplements respectively. Consequently, the calculated energy balance for these two CLA groups was lower compared to the control. Plasma levels of NEFA and BHB remained unaffected. Later in lactation the highest CLA supplementation resulted in a reduction of milk fat content of 0.7%. However, no reduction in milk fat yield, and accordingly no milk fat depression (MFD), could be shown. The trans-10, cis-12 CLA in milk fat increased with increasing dietary CLA supplementation in a dose-dependent manner. The proportion of C16 in milk fat was decreased by the highest CLA supplementation. With the exception of an increase in plasma glucose level in the CLA-2 group, no post-treatment effects were observed.

Maladaptation to these changes may result in excessive fat mobilization, dysregulation of inflammation, immunosuppression, and, ultimately, metabolic or infectious disease in the postpartum period. Up to half of the clinical diseases in the lifespan of high-yielding dairy cows occur within 3 weeks of calving. Thus, the vast majority of prospective studies on transition dairy cows are focused on the postpartum period. However, predisposition to clinical disease and key (patho)physiological events such as a spontaneous reduction in feed intake, insulin resistance, fat mobilization, and systemic inflammation already occur in the prepartum period. This review focuses on metabolic, adaptive events occurring from drying off until calving in high-yielding cows and discusses determinants that may trigger (mal)adaptation to these events in the late prepartum period.","author":[{"family":"Pascottini","given":"Osvaldo Bogado"},{"family":"Leroy","given":"Jo L.M.R."},{"family":"Opsomer","given":"Geert"}],"citation-key":"Pascottini2020","container-title":"Animals","DOI":"10.3390/ani10081419","ISSN":"20762615","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"1-17","title":"Metabolic stress in the transition period of dairy cows: Focusing on the prepartum period","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

Twelve dairy cows (90 ± 22 d in milk, 523 ± 88 kg of body weight, 7,908 ± 719 kg of milk production in the previous lactation) were housed in individual tiestalls and assigned to treatments according to a 3 × 3 Latin square design replicated 4 times. Treatments were 100% TMR (T100), 75% TMR plus 25% FF (T75), and 50% TMR plus 50% FF (T50). The experiment lasted 60 d, divided into 3 periods of 20 d each; the first 12 d of each period were used for diet adaptation and the last 8 d for data collection. The TMR (18.1% crude protein, 24.6% acid detergent fiber) and FF (<i>Lolium multiflorum</i>; 15.1% crude protein, 24.1% acid detergent fiber) were prepared and cut daily and offered to each cow individually. The highest DMI was reached in T100 and T75, which was reflected in greater intake of the different nutrients than T50. No differences were detected in the apparent total digestibility of the nutrients, mean ruminal pH, and total volatile fatty acid concentrations among treatments. Cows in T50 resulted in the lowest ruminal N-NH<sub>3</sub> concentration and the lowest microbial N flow to the duodenum. Milk yield was 8.5% higher from cows in T100 and T75 compared with T50, but we observed no differences for milk fat or milk protein yield among treatments. Milk fat of cows fed T50 had 8% more unsaturated fatty acids (FA) than that of cows fed T100, mostly because of a higher content of monounsaturated FA. Additionally, cows in T50 had a higher concentration of linoleic acid, vaccenic acid, and rumenic acid than T100. Meanwhile, the concentration of linoleic acid and vaccenic acid in cows fed T75 was higher than T100. The milk fat of the cows fed T50 and T75 had a lower n-6:n-3 ratio than T100. We concluded that including up to 29% of FF in the total DMI in combination with a TMR did not affect the intake or digestion of nutrients or the productive response in dairy cows and resulted in a higher concentration of desirable FA from a consumer's perspective.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Pastorini","given":"M."},{"family":"Pomiés","given":"N."},{"family":"Repetto","given":"J.L."},{"family":"Mendoza","given":"A."},{"family":"Cajarville","given":"C."}],"citation-key":"pastoriniProductivePerformanceDigestive2019","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/JDS.2018-15389","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,1]]},"page":"4118-4130","PMID":"30827558","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Productive performance and digestive response of dairy cows fed different diets combining a total mixed ration and fresh forage","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030219301870/fulltext","volume":"102"},

Each herd was sampled twice (winter and summer) in 2016. Samples and data collected included unused and used bedding, BTM samples, udder hygiene scores, DHIA test data, and descriptions of facilities and herd management practices. Bedding was cultured to determine the total bacteria count and counts of Bacillus spp., coliforms, Klebsiella spp., non-coliform gram-negative organisms, streptococci or streptococci-like organisms (SSLO), and Staphylococcus spp. Bedding dry matter, organic matter, and pH were also measured.

  {"id":"Patra2018","abstract":"Urea in diets of ruminants has been investigated to substitute expensive animal and vegetable protein sources for more than a century, and has been widely incorporated in diets of ruminants for many years. Urea is also recycled to the fermentative parts of the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts through saliva or direct secretory flux from blood depending upon the dietary situations. Within the GI tracts, urea is hydrolyzed to ammonia by urease enzymes produced by GI microorganisms and subsequent ammonia utilization serves the synthesis of microbial protein. In ruminants, excessive urease activity in the rumen may lead to urea/ammonia toxicity when high amounts of urea are fed to animals; and in non-ruminants, ammonia concentrations in the GI content and milieu may cause damage to the GI mucosa, resulting in impaired nutrient absorption, futile energy and protein spillage and decreased growth performance. Relatively little attention has been directed to this area by researchers. Therefore, the present review intends to discuss current knowledge in ureolytic bacterial populations, urease activities and factors affecting them, urea metabolism by microorganisms, and the application of inhibitors of urease activity in livestock animals. The information related to the ureolytic bacteria and urease activity could be useful for improving protein utilization efficiency in ruminants and for the reduction of the ammonia concentration in GI tracts of monogastric animals. Application of recent molecular methods can be expected to provide rationales for improved strategies to modulate urease and urea dynamics in the GI tract. This would lead to improved GI health, production performance and environmental compatibility of livestock production.","author":[{"family":"Patra","given":"Amlan Kumar"},{"family":"Aschenbach","given":"Jörg Rudolf"}],"citation-key":"Patra2018","container-title":"Journal of Advanced Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.jare.2018.02.005","ISSN":"20901232","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"39-50","publisher":"Cairo University","title":"Ureases in the gastrointestinal tracts of ruminant and monogastric animals and their implication in urea-N/ammonia metabolism: A review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jare.2018.02.005","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"Pavlata2004","abstract":"The aim of the present work was to study the influence of different dose of parenteral administration selenium and vitamin E in dairy cows prior to parturition on selected metabolic parameters and colostrum quality. A total of 19 dairy cows from a farm with selenium deficiency were included in the study. The cows were divided in 3 groups (C, E1, and E2). In group E1 a product containing selenium and vitamin E (Selevit inj. a.u.v.) was administered IM four weeks prior to the expected date of parturition. In group E2 the same product was administered twice, eight and four weeks prior to parturition. Group C consisted of control animals to which no product was administered. On the day of parturition samples of blood and first colostrum were collected for laboratory examination. Concentrations of selenium were determined in blood and that of vitamin E, thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) and activities of enzymes detecting muscular damage (CK, AST, LD) were determined in serum. Colostrum was analysed to determine the con- centrations of selenium, vitamin E, immunoglobulins, as well as to determine its density. The occurrence of the disease during the first month after parturition was evaluated in all groups. Higher concentrations of selenium and vitamin E were found in the samples (experimental groups E1 and E2) collected on the day of parturition. Group E2 showed a significantly (P < 0.05) higher T3 concentration compared to groups C and E1 (3.05 ± 0.42 nmol/l vs 1.88 ± 0.71 and 1.81 ± 0.30 nmol/l, respectively). The same pattern was confirmed for immunoglobulins concentrations in colostrum (34.08 ± 5.93 U ZST vs 22.87 ± 5.41 and 21.38 ± 8.33 U ZST, respectively).

  {"id":"Pena-Espinoza2018","abstract":"Increasing drug resistance in gastrointestinal (GI) parasites of livestock and concerns about chemical residues in animal products and the environment are driving the development of alternative control strategies that are less reliant on the use of synthetic drugs. An increasingly investigated approach is the use of bioactive forages with antiparasitic properties as part of the animal's diet (nutraceuticals) or as potential sources of novel, natural parasiticides. Chicory (Cichorium intybus) is a multi-purpose crop and one of the most promising bioactive forages in temperate regions, and numerous in vivo trials have explored its potential against parasitic nematodes in livestock. However, it is unclear whether chicory can induce a direct and broad activity against various GI parasites in different livestock species, and the levels of chicory in the diet that are required to exert an efficient antiparasitic effect. Moreover, the mechanisms leading to the reported parasiticidal activity of chicory are still largely unknown, and its bioactive phytochemicals have only recently been investigated. In this review, we summarise the progress in the study of the antiparasitic activity of chicory and its natural bioactive compounds against GI parasites in livestock, through examination of the published literature. The available evidence indicates that feeding chicory can reduce faecal egg counts and/or worm burdens of abomasal nematodes, but not infections with intestinal worms, in ruminants. Highly chicory-rich diets (≥ 70% of chicory dry matter in the diet) may be necessary to directly affect abomasal parasitism. Chicory is known to synthesise several bioactive compounds with potential antiparasitic activity, but most research has been devoted to the role of sesquiterpene lactones (SL). Recent in vitro studies have confirmed direct and potent activity of SL-rich extracts from chicory against different GI helminths of livestock.

  {"id":"Peng2018","abstract":"Mycotoxins are the secondary metabolites of fungi, especially moulds. They have over 300 types and can be easily produced ubiquitously by moulds. Many mycotoxins have been found to be toxic to most farmed animals through the diets. With the globalization of feed ingredient trade and the rapid climate changes, occurrence of mycotoxins become increasingly difficult to be predicted. Thus, the unnoticeable mycotoxin hazards can directly impact the animal production systems. Preventing or minimizing mycotoxins in feed ingredients has become an important topic from the aspect of feed manufacturing industry. The aim of this literature review is to summarize the effective strategies for feed manufacturers to minimize the mycotoxin hazards. Prevention methods, including pre-harvest field management and post-harvest storage management, are still the most effective strategies, since mycotoxins are hardly to be eliminated once they are present in the ingredients. Moreover, mycotoxin reducing effects of several feed manufacturing technologies are also reviewed. In this review, the mycotoxin reducing methods are mainly categorized into 4 methodologies: physical methods, thermal methods, chemical methods, and mycotoxin controlling feed additives. The first three methodologies mainly focus on how to reduce mycotoxins in feed ingredients during processes, while the last one on how to compensate the adverse impacts of mycotoxin-contaminated diets in animal bodies. The results showed that most of the methods reviewed show evident mycotoxin reducing effects, but of different consistencies. On the other hand, many practical factors that can affect the feasibility of each method in practical manufacturing are also discussed in this review. In conclusion, mycotoxin prevention management and the processing stage of cleaning and sorting are still the most efficient strategies to control mycotoxin hazards in current feed manufacturing.","author":[{"family":"Peng","given":"W.

  {"id":"Perez-Enciso2003","abstract":"We present a Bayesian method that combines linkage and linkage disequilibrium (LDL) information for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. This method uses jointly all marker information (haplotypes) and all available pedigree information; i.e., it is not restricted to any specific experimental design and it is not required that phases are known. Infinitesimal genetic effects or environmental noise (\"fixed\") effects can equally be fitted. A diallelic QTL is assumed and both additive and dominant effects can be estimated. We have implemented a combined Gibbs/Metropolis-Hastings sampling to obtain the marginal posterior distributions of the parameters of interest. We have also implemented a Bayesian variant of usual disequilibrium measures like D' and r(2) between QTL and markers. We illustrate the method with simulated data in \"simple\" (two-generation full-sib families) and \"complex\" (four-generation) pedigrees. We compared the estimates with and without using linkage disequilibrium information. In general, using LDL resulted in estimates of QTL position that were much better than linkage-only estimates when there was complete disequilibrium between the mutant QTL allele and the marker. This advantage, however, decreased when the association was only partial. In all cases, additive and dominant effects were estimated accurately either with or without disequilibrium information.","author":[{"family":"Pérez-Enciso","given":"Miguel"}],"citation-key":"Perez-Enciso2003","container-title":"Genetics","ISSN":"0016-6731","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",4]]},"page":"1497-510","PMID":"12702692","title":"Fine mapping of complex trait genes combining pedigree and linkage disequilibrium information: a Bayesian unified framework.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1462504&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","volume":"163"},

  {"id":"Peterson2005","abstract":"Our objective was to compare the effects of different prepartum dietary phosphorus concentrations on periparturient metabolism and performance. Forty-two late pregnant multiparous Holstein cows were fed 0.21, 0.31, or 0.44% P (dry basis) for 4 wk before expected calving. After parturition, all cows were fed a common lactation diet (0.40% P). In the prepartum period, cows fed 0.21% P had lower blood serum P concentrations compared with cows fed 0.31 or 0.44% P. However, serum P concentrations of all cows were within the normal range (4 to 8 mg/dL) until the day of calving when average concentrations dropped below 4 mg/dL. From 3 to 14 d postpartum, serum P of cows fed 0.21% P was greater than that of cows fed 0.31 or 0.44% P. No cows presented with or were treated for clinical hypophosphatemia in the periparturient period. Total serum Ca was lower before calving through 2 d postpartum for cows fed 0.44% P compared with those fed 0.21 or 0.31%. Prepartum dietary P treatments did not alter blood osteocalcin, hydroxyproline, and deoxypyridinoline, indicators of bone metabolism, or concentrations of parathyroid hormone or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Energy-corrected milk yield and milk composition (first 28 d of lactation) were not affected by prepartum dietary P concentrations. It is concluded that feeding 0.21% P (34 g of P/cow daily) prepartum is adequate for periparturient multiparous Holstein cows with high metabolic demands and genetic potential for milk production. No adverse effects on periparturient health, dry matter intake, or 28-d lactation performance resulted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",11,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Peterson","given":"a B"},{"family":"Orth","given":"M W"},{"family":"Goff","given":"J P"},{"family":"Beede","given":"D K"}],"citation-key":"Peterson2005","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)73043-5","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",10]]},"page":"3582-94","PMID":"16162532","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Periparturient responses of multiparous Holstein cows fed different dietary phosphorus concentrations prepartum.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16162532","volume":"88"},

  {"id":"Petit2002","abstract":"Four multiparous Holstein cows were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square experiment to study the effects of fat sources rich in omega-3 fatty acids on milk production and composition, follicular development, and prostaglandin secretion. All cows were fed a total mixed diet containing 60% grass silage and 40% concentrate. The four treatments were concentrates based either on Megalac, formaldehyde-treated whole linseed, a mixture (50:50, oil basis) of fish oil and formaldehyde-treated whole linseed, or no fat source in the concentrate but with 500 g per day of linseed oil being infused into the duodenum. Feed intakes and milk yield were similar among treatments. In general, the lowest digestibility was observed for the formaldehyde-treated whole linseed treatment. Feeding fish oil decreased milk fat and protein percentages. Alpha-linolenic acid increased from 1.0 to 13.9% of milk fatty acids with linseed oil infusion. This confirms the high potential to incorporate alpha-linolenic acid into milk, and suggests that the formaldehyde treatment had little effect to limit biohydrogenation in the rumen. Increasing the supply of alpha-linolenic acid to these cows did not result in an increase in the concentration of eicosapentaenoic acid in milk. Levels of 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGF2alpha in plasma were higher for cows receiving formaldehyde-treated linseed and fish oil. Increases in this metabolite in response to oxytocin challenge, tended to be lower for cows given linseed either as sole oil supplement in the diet or as a duodenal infusion of linseed oil. Follicle dynamics were similar among treatments. Larger corpora lutea (CL) were found with cows that received high levels of omega-3 fatty acids through the diet as formaldehyde-treated linseed or as a mixture of formaldehyde-treated linseed and fish oil, although CL were smaller when cows were infused with linseed oil into the duodenum. These results suggest that the improvement in gestation rate that was observed when feeding increased levels of alpha-linolenic acid in earlier work may partly result from lower levels of production of the dienoic prostaglandin PGF2alpha.","author":[{"family":"Petit","given":"H V"},{"family":"Dewhurst","given":"R J"},{"family":"Scollan","given":"N D"},{"family":"Proulx","given":"J G"},{"family":"Khalid","given":"M"},{"family":"Haresign","given":"W"},{"family":"Twagiramungu","given":"H"},{"family":"Mann","given":"G E"}],"citation-key":"Petit2002","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(02)74147-7","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",4]]},"page":"889-99","PMID":"12018434","title":"Milk production and composition, ovarian function, and prostaglandin secretion of dairy cows fed omega-3 fats.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12018434","volume":"85"},

Cows were fed lipid supplements from 6 wk before the expected date of parturition until d 28 of lactation. Cows within each block were assigned to 1 of 3 isonitrogenous and isoenergetic dietary supplements: control with no added lipids (CO); unsaturated lipids supplied as whole flaxseed (FL; 3.3 and 11.0% of the dry matter in prepartum and postpartum diets, respectively); and saturated lipids supplied as Energy Booster (EB; 1.7 and 3.5% of the DM in prepartum and postpartum diets, respectively). Diets EB and FL had similar ether extract concentrations. Multiparous cows fed EB had lower dry matter intake and milk production, higher concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate in plasma and triglycerides (TG) and total lipids in liver, and lower concentrations of plasma glucose and liver glycogen than those fed FL and CO. Production of 4% fat-corrected milk was similar among treatments. Multiparous cows fed FL had the highest liver concentrations of glycogen on wk 2 and 4 after calving and lowest concentrations of TG on wk 4 after calving. Liver C16:0 relative percentages in multiparous cows increased after calving whereas those of C18:0 decreased. Relative percentages of liver C16:0 were higher in wk 2 and 4 postpartum for multiparous cows fed EB compared with those fed CO and FL; those of C18:0 were lower in wk 4 postpartum for cows fed EB compared with those fed CO and FL. Liver C18:1 relative percentages of multiparous cows increased after calving and were higher in wk 4 for cows fed EB compared with those fed CO and FL. The inverse was observed for liver C18:2 relative percentages. In general, diets had more significant effects on plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids, β-hydroxybutyrate, and glucose and liver profiles of fatty acids, TG, total lipids, and glycogen of multiparous than primiparous cows. These data suggest that feeding a source of saturated fatty acids increased the risk of fatty liver in the transition cow compared with feeding no lipids or whole flaxseed. Feeding flaxseed compared with no lipids or a source of saturated fatty acids from 6 wk before calving could be a useful strategy to increase liver concentrations of glycogen and decrease liver concentrations of TG after calving, which may prevent the development of fatty liver in the transition dairy cow. © American Dairy Science Association, 2007.","author":[{"family":"Petit","given":"H.

  {"id":"Petri2019","abstract":"High starch lactation diets not only enhance the risk of subacute ruminal acidosis but also of hindgut acidosis, which increases the risk of dysbiosis and the depression of fiber degradation. We recently showed that replacing corn with molassed sugar beet pulp (Bp) improved fiber degradation in high-producing dairy cattle, possibly because of an improvement of rumen and hindgut conditions for microbes by Bp feeding. However, little is known about the effects of high inclusion rates of Bp on hindgut microbes and fermentation. Thus fecal grab samples were taken from 18 high-yielding Simmental cows after 28 d of feeding 3 different levels of Bp (n = 6) for bacterial 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. In addition, the reticular pH was continuously monitored with indwelling sensors and eating and ruminating behavior was evaluated with noseband sensors. The Bp inclusion rates were 0 g/kg (i.e., no Bp inclusion as control, CON), 120 g/kg (12Bp), or 240 g/kg (24Bp) replacing corn grain and limestone on a dry matter basis. The amount of time spent eating and ruminating was unaffected by Bp level, and the daily fluctuation in the reticular pH was reduced by 25% with Bp inclusion from 0.8 in the CON diet to 0.6 in 24Bp fed animals. Also, the fecal pH tended to increase with dietary Bp inclusion. Fecal acetate production showed a quadratic tendency with the lowest concentration (58.9%) of the total short-chain fatty acid in the 12Bp treatment. Inclusion of Bp up to 24% of the diet decreased the fecal butyrate proportion by 27%. The Shannon diversity index was increased from 5.50 to 8.09 with dietary Bp inclusion indicating increased species diversity. Of the 200 most abundant operational taxonomic units, 25 were increased by dietary Bp inclusion, whereas 15 were decreased and 7 were quadratically affected. The second most abundant group was proposed taxon “CF231” of the family Paraprevotellaceae. Although it accounted for only 2.52% of the operational taxonomic units in the CON diet, it was increased by 64% with dietary Bp inclusion. The biggest relative change in the abundance was found for the genus Fibrobacter that increased more than 14-fold from 0.04% (CON) to 0.66% (24Bp). In conclusion, feeding molassed sugar beet pulp as partial substitution of corn up to 240 g/kg is a viable alternative that promotes ruminal and hindgut fermentation by supporting physiological pH and bacterial diversity.","author":[{"family":"Petri","given":"Renee Maxine"},{"family":"Münnich","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Zebeli","given":"Qendrim"},{"family":"Klevenhusen","given":"Fenja"}],"citation-key":"Petri2019","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2018-15704","ISSN":"00220302","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"5019-5030","title":"Graded replacement of corn grain with molassed sugar beet pulp modulates the fecal microbial community and hindgut fermentation profile in lactating dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002203021930298X"},

Thirty percent of the dry matter (DM) in the diets consisted of alfalfa forage, which was fed as either hay or silage. The DM from alfalfa silage DM was substituted at 0, 33, 67, and 100% for DM from alfalfa hay and was fed to four ruminally and abomasally cannulated steers. The roughage component of the diet constituted 50% of the DM and consisted of 60% alfalfa silage or hay and 40% tropical corn silage. The concentrate was composed mainly of ground corn. The concentrations of putrescine and cadaverine in abomasal digesta increased as alfalfa silage in the diet increased. Abomasal recovery of biogenic amines, a product of their concentration in abomasal digesta and the passage of DM through the abomasum, was negatively correlated with intake. Abomasal recovery of most amines was 5 to 20% of intake. Abomasal recovery of cadaverine was correlated with depressed intake.

Ruminal fluid pH and NH3 concentration increased in steers fed more alfalfa silage; however, mass and the DM percentage of ruminal contents decreased linearly. Postprandial insulin concentrations were quadratically related to the proportion of alfalfa hay or silage in the diet.

  {"id":"Piantoni2008","abstract":"Prepubertal mammary development can be affected by nutrition partly through alterations in gene network expression. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) remains the most accurate method to measure mRNA expression but is subject to analytical errors that introduce variation. Thus, qPCR data normalization through the use of internal control genes (ICG) is required. The objective of this study was to mine microarray data (> 10,000 genes) from prepubertal mammary parenchyma and stroma to identify the most suitable ICG for normalization of qPCR. Tissue for RNA extraction was obtained from calves ( approximately 63 d old; n = 5/diet) fed a control (200 g/kg crude protein, 210 g/kg crude fat, fed at 441 g/d dry matter) or a high-protein milk replacer (280 g/kg crude protein, 200 g/kg crude fat, fed at 951 g/d dry matter). ICG were selected based on both absence of expression variation across treatment and of coregulation (gene network analysis). Genes evaluated were ubiquitously expressed transcript, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory (inhibitor) subunit 11 (PPP1R11), matrix metallopeptidase 14 (MMP14), ClpB caseinolytic peptidase B, SAPS domain family member 1 (SAPS1), mitochondrial GTPase 1 (MTG1), mitochondrial ribosomal protein L39, ribosomal protein S15a (RPS15A), and actin beta (ACTB). Network analysis demonstrated that MMP14 and ACTB are coregulated by v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene, tumor protein p53, and potentially insulin-like growth factor 1. Pairwise comparison of expression ratios showed that ACTB, MMP14, and SAPS1 had the lowest stability and were unsuitable as ICG. PPP1R11, RPS15A, and MTG1 were the most stable among ICG tested. We conclude that the geometric mean of PPP1R11, RPS15A, and MTG1 is ideal for normalization of qPCR data in prepubertal bovine mammary tissue. This study provides a list of candidate ICG that could be used by researchers working in bovine mammary development and allied fields.","author":[{"family":"Piantoni","given":"Paola"},{"family":"Bionaz","given":"Massimo"},{"family":"Graugnard","given":"Daniel E"},{"family":"Daniels","given":"Kristy M"},{"family":"Akers","given":"R Michael"},{"family":"Loor","given":"Juan J"}],"citation-key":"Piantoni2008","container-title":"The Journal of nutrition","ISSN":"1541-6100","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",6]]},"page":"1158-64","PMID":"18492850","title":"Gene expression ratio stability evaluation in prepubertal bovine mammary tissue from calves fed different milk replacers reveals novel internal controls for quantitative polymerase chain reaction.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18492850","volume":"138"},

Calves in the accelerated nutrition groups received 951 g/d of high-protein/low-fat MR (HPLF; 28% CP, 20% fat, DM basis), 951 g/d of high-protein/high-fat MR (HPHF; 28% CP, 28% fat, DM basis), or 1,431 g/d of HPHF (HPHF+) MR. Out of 13,000 genes evaluated, over 1,500 differentially expressed genes (DEG) were affected (false discovery rate <0.10) by level of nutrient intake in PAR or MFP. Feeding HPLF versus CON resulted in the most dramatic changes in gene expression, with 278 and 588 DEG having ≥1.5-fold change in PAR and MFP. In PAR, the most-altered molecular functions were associated with metabolism of the cell (molecular transport and lipid metabolism) with most of the genes downregulated in HPLF versus CON. In MFP, DEG also were primarily associated with metabolism but changes also occurred in genes linked to cell morphology, cell-to-cell signaling, and immune response. Compared with CON, feeding HPHF or HPHF+ did not result in substantial additional effects on DEG beyond those observed with HPLF. The pentose phosphate, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ubiquinone biosynthesis pathways were among the most enriched due to HPLF versus CON in PAR and were inhibited, whereas glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, and eicosanoid synthesis pathways were among the most enriched due to HPLF versus CON in MFP and were inhibited. These responses suggest that, in PAR, doubling nutrient intake from standard feeding rates inhibited energy metabolism and activity of oxidative pathways that partly serve to protect cells against oxidative stress. The MFP in those heifers appeared to decrease production of lipid-derived metabolites that may play roles in signaling pathways within the adipocyte. Overall, results indicated that prepubertal/preweaned mammary transcriptome is responsive to long-term enhanced nutrient supply to achieve greater growth rates before weaning. The biological significance of these results to future milk production remains to be elucidated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Piantoni","given":"P"},{"family":"Daniels","given":"K M"},{"family":"Everts","given":"R E"},{"family":"Rodriguez-Zas","given":"S L"},{"family":"Lewin","given":"H","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Hurley","given":"W L"},{"family":"Akers","given":"R M"},{"family":"Loor","given":"J J"}],"citation-key":"Piantoni2012","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2011-4539","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",5]]},"page":"2550-61","PMID":"22541482","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Level of nutrient intake affects mammary gland gene expression profiles in preweaned Holstein heifers.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22541482","volume":"95"},
  {"id":"Piantoni2013","abstract":"The effects of palmitic acid supplementation on feed intake, digestibility, and metabolic and production responses were evaluated in dairy cows with a wide range of milk production (34.5 to 66.2 kg/d) in a crossover design experiment with a covariate period. Thirty-two multiparous Holstein cows (151 ± 66 d in milk) were randomly assigned to treatment sequence within level of milk production. Treatments were diets supplemented (2% of diet DM) with palmitic acid (PA; 99% C16:0) or control (SH; soyhulls). Treatment periods were 21 d, with the final 4 d used for data and sample collection. Immediately before the first treatment period, cows were fed the control diet for 21 d and baseline values were obtained for all variables (covariate period). Milk production measured during the covariate period (preliminary milk yield) was used as covariate. In general, no interactions were detected between treatment and preliminary milk yield for the response variables measured. The PA treatment increased milk fat percentage (3.40 vs. 3.29%) and yields of milk (46.0 vs. 44.9 kg/d), milk fat (1.53 vs. 1.45 kg/d), and 3.5% fat-corrected milk (44.6 vs. 42.9 kg/d), compared with SH. Concentrations and yields of protein and lactose were not affected by treatment. The PA treatment did not affect dry matter (DM) intake or body weight, tended to decrease body condition score (2.93 vs. 2.99), and increased feed efficiency (3.5% fat-corrected milk/DM intake; 1.60 vs. 1.54), compared with SH. The PA treatment increased total-tract digestibility of neutral detergent fiber (39.0 vs.35.7%) and organic matter (67.9 vs. 66.2%), but decreased fatty acid (FA) digestibility (61.2 vs. 71.3%). As total FA intake increased, total FA digestibility decreased (R(2) = 0.51) and total FA absorbed increased (quadratic R(2) = 0.82). Fatty acid yield response, calculated as the additional FA yield secreted in milk per unit of additional FA intake, was 11.7% for total FA and 16.5% for C16:0 plus cis-9 C16:1 FA. The PA treatment increased plasma concentration of nonesterified FA (101 vs. 90.0 μEq/L) and cholecystokinin (19.7 vs. 17.6 pmol/L), and tended to increase plasma concentration of insulin (10.7 vs. 9.57 μ IU/mL). Results show that palmitic acid fed at 2% of diet DM has the potential to increase yields of milk and milk fat, independent of production level without increasing body condition score or body weight. However, a small percentage of the supplemented FA was partitioned to milk.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Piantoni","given":"P"},{"family":"Lock","given":"A L"},{"family":"Allen","given":"M S"}],"citation-key":"Piantoni2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2013-6680","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",11]]},"page":"7143-54","PMID":"24011949","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Palmitic acid increased yields of milk and milk fat and nutrient digestibility across production level of lactating cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24011949","volume":"96"},

  {"id":"Piantoni2015a","abstract":"To evaluate propylene glycol (PG) and glycerol (G) as potential treatments for ketosis, we conducted 2 experiments lasting 4 d each in which cows received one bolus infusion per day. Blood was collected before infusion, over 240min postinfusion, as well as 24 h postinfusion. Experiment 1 used 6 ruminally cannulated cows (26±7 d in milk) randomly assigned to 300-mL infusions of PG or G (both ≥99.5% pure) in a crossover design experiment with 2 periods. Within each period, cows were assigned randomly to infusion site sequence: abomasum (A)-cranial reticulorumen (R) or the reverse, R-A. Glucose precursors were infused into the R to simulate drenching and the A to prevent metabolism by ruminal microbes. Glycerol infused in the A increased plasma glucose concentration the most (15.8mg/dL), followed by PG infused in the R (12.6mg/dL), PG infused in the A (9.11mg/dL), and G infused in the R (7.3mg/dL). Infusion of PG into the R increased plasma insulin and insulin area under the curve (AUC) the most compared with all other treatments (7.88 vs. 2.13μIU/mL and 321 vs. 31.9min×μIU/mL, respectively). Overall, PG decreased plasma BHBA concentration after infusion (-6.46 vs. -4.55mg/dL) and increased BHBA AUC (-1,055 vs. -558min ×mg/dL) compared with G. Plasma NEFA responses were not different among treatments. Experiment 2 used 8 ruminally cannulated cows (22±5 d in milk) randomly assigned to treatment sequence in a Latin square design experiment balanced for carryover effects. Treatments were 300mL of PG, 300mL of G, 600mL of G (2G), and 300mL of PG + 300mL of G (GPG), all infused into the R. Treatment contrasts compared PG with each treatment containing glycerol (G, 2G, and GPG). Propylene glycol increased plasma glucose (14.0 vs. 5.35mg/dL) and insulin (7.59 vs. 1.11μIU/mL) concentrations compared with G, but only tended to increase glucose and insulin concentrations compared with 2G. Propylene glycol increased AUC for glucose (1,444 vs. 94.3mg/dL) and insulin (326 vs. 6.58min×μIU/mL) compared with G, and tended to increase insulin AUC compared with 2G. Propylene glycol was not different from GPG for glucose, insulin, or BHBA responses. Propylene glycol decreased plasma BHBA concentration (-10.3 vs. -4.21mg/dL) and increased BHBA AUC (-1,578 vs. -1.42min ×mg/dL) compared with G, but not compared with 2G. In general, and compared with G, GPG decreased plasma NEFA concentrations after infusions and PG decreased plasma NEFA concentrations early but not late after infusions. We conclude that a 300-mL dose of PG is more effective at increasing plasma glucose concentration than G and at least as effective as 600mL of G or a combination of G and PG when administered in the cranial reticulorumen.","author":[{"family":"Piantoni","given":"P."},{"family":"Allen","given":"M.S."}],"citation-key":"Piantoni2015a","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2015-9476","ISBN":"1525-3198 (Electronic)\\r0022-0302 (Linking)","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"5429-5439","PMID":"26074245","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Evaluation of propylene glycol and glycerol infusions as treatments for ketosis in dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030215004154","volume":"98"},

  {"id":"piepenbrinkFeeding2hydroxy4Methylthio2004","abstract":"Forty-eight Holstein cows, entering second or later lactation, were utilized to determine the effects of 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)-butanoic acid (HMB) on milk production, hepatic lipid metabolism, and gluconeogenesis during the periparturient period. Cows were fed one of 3 diets as TMR starting 21 d before expected calving. These diets contained 0 (the basal diet), 0.09 (+HMB), or 0.18 (++HMB)% HMB. From parturition to 84 DIM, cows were fed diets that contained 0, 0.13, or 0.20% HMB. Prepartum and postpartum dry matter intakes were similar among cows fed the basal diet, +HMB and ++HMB. There was a quadratic effect on milk yield such that cows fed +HMB had the greatest milk yield; yields of milk by cows fed the basal diet and ++HMB were similar. This led to trends for increased yields of 3.5% fat-corrected milk and total solids when cows were fed +HMB. Percentages of fat, protein, and total solids in milk were not affected by treatment. Despite differences in milk yield, calculated energy balance was not affected by treatment. Plasma concentrations of NEFA, β-hydroxybutyrate, and glucose were not different among treatments. Liver triglyceride content was similar among treatments on d 1 postpartum and was increased for cows consuming +HMB on d 21 postpartum compared with the other dietary treatments. Capacities for metabolism of [1-14C]palmitate by liver slices in vitro were not affected by treatment; however, conversion of [1-14C]propionate to CO2 and glucose decreased as the amount of HMB consumed by cows increased on d 21 postpartum. Cows consuming +HMB had greater days to first ovulation compared with cows consuming the basal diet and ++HMB as measured by plasma progesterone concentrations. These data suggest that adding HMB to low Met diets to achieve a predicted Met supply of approximately 2.3% of metabolizable protein supply is beneficial for increasing milk production but does not appear to benefit hepatic energy metabolism during early lactation. © American Dairy Science Association, 2004.","author":[{"family":"Piepenbrink","given":"M.

The effects of MCFA-supplementation on the likelihood of intramammary infections (IMI) in early lactation, and test-day somatic cell count (SCC) and average daily milk yield (MY) during the first 4 months of lactation were evaluated as well. Twenty-two animals were included of which half were orally supplemented with MCFA starting 6-8 weeks prior to calving and half served as non-supplemented controls. The PMNL viability in both blood and milk was quantified using dual-colour flow cytometry with fluorescein-labelled annexin and propidium iodide. In non-supplemented animals, % blood PMNL apoptosis significantly increased between start of supplementation and early lactation, reflecting a potential reduction in innate immune capacity, whereas this was not true in the MCFA-supplemented animals. Similar results were seen in milk PMNL apoptosis. Overall, the % apoptotic milk PMNL between 1 and 3 DIM was significantly lower in the MCFA-supplemented group compared with the non-supplemented group. There was no substantial effect of oral MCFA-supplementation on the likelihood of quarter IMI nor on the composite test-day milk SCC or average daily MY. In conclusion, oral MCFA-supplementation starting 6-8 weeks before expected calving date supported the blood and milk neutrophil viability in early lactating dairy cows. Still, this was not reflected in an improvement of udder health nor MY in early and later lactation. The results should trigger research to further unravel the mechanisms behind the observed immunomodulating effect, and the potential relevance for the cows' performances throughout lactation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Piepers","given":"Sofie"},{"family":"De Vliegher","given":"Sarne"}],"citation-key":"Piepers2013","container-title":"The Journal of dairy research","DOI":"10.1017/S0022029913000228","ISBN":"0022029913000","ISSN":"1469-7629","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",8]]},"page":"309-18","PMID":"23570511","title":"Oral supplementation of medium-chain fatty acids during the dry period supports the neutrophil viability of peripartum dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23570511","volume":"80"},

The experiment was conducted as a 4×4 Latin square design with a 2×2 factorial arrangement: 2 concentrations of dietary starch [low vs. high: 23.7 and 27.7% on a dry matter (DM) basis; neutral detergent fiber/starch ratios: 1.47 and 1.12], the presence or absence of FO supplement (0.80% on a DM basis), and their interaction were evaluated. Four Italian Friesian cows were fed 1 of the following 4 diets in 4 consecutive 26-d periods: (1) low starch (LS), (2) low starch plus FO (LSO), (3) high starch (HS), and (4) high starch plus FO (HSO). The diets contained the same amount of forages (corn silage, alfalfa and meadow hays). The starch concentration was balanced using different proportions of corn meal and soybean hulls. The cows were housed in metabolic stalls inside open-circuit respiration chambers to allow measurement of CH4 emission and the collection of separate urine and feces. No differences among treatments were observed for DM intake. We observed a trend for FO to increase milk yield: 29.2 and 27.5kg/d, on average, for diets with and without FO, respectively. Milk fat was affected by the interaction between dietary starch and FO: milk fat decreased only in the HSO diet. Energy-corrected milk (ECM) was affected by the interaction between starch and FO, with a positive effect of FO on the LS diet. Fish oil supplementation decreased the n-6:n-3 ratio of milk polyunsaturated fatty acids. High-starch diets negatively influenced all digestibility parameters measured except starch, whereas FO improved neutral detergent fiber digestibility (41.9 vs. 46.1% for diets without and with FO, respectively, and ether extract digestibility (53.7 vs. 67.1% for diets without and with FO, respectively). We observed a trend for lower CH4 emission (g/d) and intensity (g/kg of milk) with the high-starch diets compared with the low-starch diets: 396 versus 415g/d on average, respectively, and 14.1 versus 14.9g/kg of milk, respectively.

  {"id":"Pitta2019","abstract":"Diet-induced milk fat depression (MFD) is a condition marked by a reduction in milk fat yield experimentally achieved by increasing dietary unsaturated fatty acids and fermentable carbohydrates. 2-Hydroxy-4-(methylthio) butanoate (HMTBa) is a methionine analog observed to reduce diet-induced MFD in dairy cows. We hypothesize that the reduction in diet-induced MFD by HMTBa is due to changes in the rumen microbiota. To test this, 22 high-producing cannulated Holstein dairy cows were placed into 2 groups using a randomized block design and assigned to either control or HMTBa supplementation (0.1% of diet dry matter). All cows were then exposed to 3 different diets with a low risk (32% neutral detergent fiber, no added oil; fed d 1 to 7), a moderate risk (29% neutral detergent fiber and 0.75% soybean oil; fed d 8 to 24), or a high risk (29% neutral detergent fiber and 1.5% soybean oil; fed d 25 to 28) for diet-induced MFD. Rumen samples were collected on d 0, 14, 24, and 28, extracted for DNA, PCR-amplified for the V1–V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene, sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA), and subjected to bacterial diversity analysis using the QIIME pipeline. The α diversity estimates (species richness and Shannon diversity) were decreased in the control group compared with the HMTBa group. Bacterial community composition also differed between control and HMTBa groups based on both weighted UniFrac (relative abundance of commonly detected bacteria) and unweighted UniFrac (presence/absence) distances. Within the HMTBa group, no differences were observed in bacterial community composition between d 0 and d 14, 24, and 28; however, in the control group, d 0 samples were different from d 14, 24, and 28. Certain bacterial genera including Dialister, Megasphaera, Lachnospira, and Sharpea were increased in the control group compared with the HMTBa group. Interestingly, these genera were positively correlated with milk fat trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid and trans-10 C18:1, fatty acid isomers associated with biohydrogenation-induced MFD. It can be concluded that diet-induced MFD is accompanied by significant alterations in the rumen bacterial community and that HMTBa supplementation reduces these microbial perturbations.","author":[{"family":"Pitta","given":"D.

  {"id":"Piyasatian2007","abstract":"Efficiency of genomic selection with low-cost genotyping in a composite line from a cross between inbred lines was evaluated for a trait with heritability 0.10 or 0.25 using a low-density marker map. With genomic selection, selection was on the sum of estimates of effects of all marker intervals across the genome, fitted either as fixed (fixed GS) or random (random GS) effects. Reponses to selection over 10 generations, starting from the F(2), were compared with standard BLUP selection. Estimates of variance for each interval were assumed independent and equal. Both GS strategies outperformed BLUP selection, especially in initial generations. Random GS outperformed fixed GS in early generations and performed slightly better than fixed GS in later generations. Random GS gave higher genetic gain when the number of marker intervals was greater (180 or 10 cM intervals), whereas fixed GS gave higher genetic gain when the number of marker intervals was low (90 or 20 cM). Including interactions between generation and marker scores in the model resulted in lower genetic gains than models without interactions. When phenotypes were available only in the F(2) for GS, treating marker scores as fixed effects led to considerably lower genetic gain than random GS. Benefits of GS over standard BLUP were lower with high heritability. Genomic selection resulted in greater response than MAS based on only significant marker intervals (standard MAS) by increasing the frequency of QTL with both large and small effects. The efficiency of genomic selection over standard MAS depends on stringency of the threshold used for QTL detection.

  {"id":"pizzorno2015","abstract":"The trace mineral boron is a micronutrient with diverse and vitally important roles in metabolism that render it necessary for plant, animal, and human health, and as recent research suggests, possibly for the evolution of life on Earth. As the current article shows, boron has been proven to be an important trace mineral because it (1) is essential for the growth and maintenance of bone; (2) greatly improves wound healing; (3) beneficially impacts the body’s use of estrogen, testosterone, and vitamin D; (4) boosts magnesium absorption; (5) reduces levels of inflammatory biomarkers, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α); (6) raises levels of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase; (7) protects against pesticide-induced oxidative stress and heavy-metal toxicity; (8) improves the brains electrical activity, cognitive performance, and short-term memory for elders; (9) influences the formation and activity of key biomolecules, such as S-adenosyl methionine (SAM-e) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ ); (10) has demonstrated preventive and therapeutic effects in a number of cancers, such as prostate, cervical, and lung cancers, and multiple and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma; and (11) may help ameliorate the adverse effects of traditional chemotherapeutic agents.

  {"id":"plaizierInvitedReviewEffect2022","abstract":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2><p>Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) is assumed to be a common disease in high-yielding dairy cows. Despite this, the epidemiological evidence is limited by the lack of survey data. The prevalence of SARA has mainly been determined by measuring the pH of ruminal fluid collected using rumenocentesis. This may not be sufficiently accurate, because the symptoms of SARA are not solely due to ruminal pH depression, and ruminal pH varies among sites in the rumen, throughout a 24-h period, and among days. The impact of SARA has mainly been studied by conducting SARA challenges in cows, sheep, and goats based on a combination of feed restriction and high-grain feeding. The methodologies of these challenges vary considerably among studies. Variations include differences in the duration and amount of grain feeding, type of grain, amount and duration of feed restriction, number of experimental cows, and sensitivity of cows to SARA challenges. Grain-based SARA challenges affect gut health. These effects include depressing the pH in, and increasing the toxin content of, digesta. They also include altering the taxonomic composition of microbiota, reducing the functionality of the epithelia throughout the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), and a moderate inflammatory response. The effects on the epithelia include a reduction in its barrier function. Effects on microbiota include reductions in their richness and diversity, which may reduce their functionality and reflect dysbiosis. Changes in the taxonomic composition of gut microbiota throughout the GIT are evident at the phylum level, but less evident and more variable at the genus level. Effects at the phylum level include an increase in the <i>Firmicutes</i> to <i>Bacteroidetes</i> ratio. More studies on the effects of a SARA challenge on the functionality of gut microbiota are needed. The inflammatory response resulting from grain-based SARA challenges is innate and moderate and mainly consists of an acute phase response. This response is likely a combination of systemic inflammation and inflammation of the epithelia of the GIT. The systemic inflammation is assumed to be caused by translocation of immunogenic compounds, including bacterial endotoxins and bioamines, through the epithelia into the interior circulation. This translocation is increased by the increase in concentrations of toxins in digesta and a reduction of the barrier function of epithelia. Severe SARA can cause rumenitis, but moderate SARA may activate an immune response in the epithelia of the GIT. Cows grazing highly fermentable pastures with high sugar contents can also have a low ruminal pH indicative of SARA. This is not accompanied by an inflammatory response but may affect milk production and gut microbiota. Grain-based SARA affects several aspects of gut health, but SARA resulting from grazing high-digestible pastures and insufficient coarse fiber less so. We need to determine which method for inducing SARA is the most representative of on-farm conditions.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Plaizier","given":"J.C."},{"family":"Mulligan","given":"F.J."},{"family":"Neville","given":"E.W."},{"family":"Guan","given":"L.L."},{"family":"Steele","given":"M.A."},{"family":"Penner","given":"G.B."}],"citation-key":"plaizierInvitedReviewEffect2022","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/JDS.2022-21960","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7]]},"PMID":"35879171","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Invited review: Effect of subacute ruminal acidosis on gut health of dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030222004192/fulltext","volume":"0"},

  {"id":"Poppy2012a","abstract":"The purpose of this study was to use meta-analytic methods to estimate the effect of a commercially available yeast culture product on milk production and other production measures in lactating dairy cows using a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Sixty-one research publications (published journal articles, published abstracts, and technical reports) were identified through a review of literature provided by the manufacturer and a search of published literature using 6 search engines. Thirty-six separate studies with 69 comparisons met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The fixed-effect meta-analysis showed substantial heterogeneity for milk yield, energy-corrected milk, 3.5% fat-corrected milk, milk fat yield, and milk protein yield. Sub-group analysis of the data showed much less heterogeneity in peer-reviewed studies versus non-peer-reviewed abstracts and technical reports, and tended to show higher, but not significantly different, treatment effects. A random-effects meta-analysis showed estimated raw mean differences between treated and untreated cattle reported in peer-reviewed publications of 1.18kg/d [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.55 to 1.81], 1.61kg/d (95% CI: 0.92 to 2.29), and 1.65kg/d (95% CI: 0.97 to 2.34) for milk yield, 3.5% fat-corrected milk, and energy-corrected milk, respectively. Milk fat yield and milk protein yield for peer-reviewed studies showed an increase in the raw mean difference of 0.06kg/d (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.10) and 0.03kg/d (95% CI: 0.00 to 0.05), respectively. Estimated raw mean dry matter intake of the peer-reviewed studies during early lactation (<70 d in milk) and not-early lactation were 0.62kg/d (95% CI: 0.21 to 1.02) and a decrease of 0.78kg/d (95% CI: −1.36 to −0.21), respectively. These findings provide strong evidence that this commercially available yeast culture product provides significant improvement in several important milk production outcomes as evaluated in production settings typical for commercial dairies in North America. Utilizing meta-analytic methods to study the complete breadth of information relating to a specific treatment by studying multiple overcomes of all eligible studies can reduce the uncertainty often seen in small individual studies designed without sufficient power to detect differences in treatments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Poppy","given":"G.D.

  {"id":"Pritchard2013","abstract":"Premature mortality and culling causes great wastage in the dairy industry, as a large number of heifers born never become productive or are culled before their full lactation potential is reached. The objectives of this study were to characterize survival and estimate genetic parameters for alternative longevity traits that considered (1) the survival of replacement heifers and (2) functional longevity of milking cows in the UK Holstein Friesian population, using combined information from the British Cattle Movement Service and milk recording organizations. Mortality of heifers was highest in the first month of life and was proportionately highest in calves born during winter months. Heifer mortality tended to decrease with age until about 16 mo onward; it then gradually increased, expected to be associated with culls due to reproductive failure or problems during pregnancy and calving. In milking cows, days of productive life (DPL) was analyzed as an alternative to the current trait lifespan score. Cows that died in 2009 on average lived for 6.8 yr with an average production of 4.3 yr. Heritability estimates were low for both heifer and cow survival and were ∼0.01 and ∼0.06, respectively. The positive genetic correlation between heifer survival with lifespan score (0.31) indicates that bulls that sire daughters with longer productive lives are also likely to have calves that survive and become replacement heifers. However, the magnitude of the genetic correlation suggests that survival in the rearing period and the milking herd are different traits. Genetic correlations were favorable between DPL with somatic cell count and fertility traits indicating that animals with a longer productive life tend to have lower somatic cell count, a shorter calving interval, fewer days to first service, and require fewer inseminations. However, an antagonistic relationship existed between DPL with milk and fat yield traits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Pritchard","given":"T"},{"family":"Coffey","given":"M"},{"family":"Mrode","given":"R"},{"family":"Wall","given":"E"}],"citation-key":"Pritchard2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-6219","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,8]]},"page":"3296-3309","PMID":"23477814","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Understanding the genetics of survival in dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23477814","volume":"96"},

  {"id":"Proudfoot2018","abstract":"Social factors are important determinants of disease in humans and and laboratory animals, but less research has been done using farm animals. The objective of this study was to determine if an unpredictable and competitive social environment affects behavior and health during the transition period when dairy cows are at high risk of disease. Five weeks before calving, 64 cows were assigned to a predictable and noncompetitive social environment (predictable) or an unpredictable and competitive social environment (unpredictable) using 8 groups of 4 animals per treatment. Each group consisted of 3 multiparous and 1 primiparous cow. At first enrollment (baseline; 5 wk before calving), all groups had access to 4 electronic feed bins. At 4 wk before calving, cows in the predictable groups were given access to 6 feed bins, and cows in the unpredictable groups were moved into a new pen with 4 resident cows each trained to consume feed from one bin. Each cow in the unpredictable group was then provided access to only 1 of the 4 feed bins which they shared with 1 resident cow (resulting in 2 cows/bin), creating a competitive feeding environment. To create an unpredictable environment, access to morning feed was delayed 0, 1, 2, or 3 h every other day. On alternate days, the cows in unpredictable groups were assigned to feed from a new feed bin (and thus had to compete with a new resident partner). Feeding and social behavior were collected electronically from the feed bins. Blood was sampled at baseline (wk -5), wk -2, wk -1, and wk +1 relative to calving to measure inflammatory (haptoglobin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and metabolic (nonesterified fatty acids, beta-hydroxybutyrate, calcium, and glucose) biomarkers. Uterine cytology was performed 3 to 5 wk after calving to diagnose cytological endometritis. Data were analyzed using mixed models including baseline data as a covariate, week as a repeated measure, treatment as a main effect, and a treatment by week interaction. The probability of cytological endometritis at the group level was analyzed using Mann-Whitney U tests. Parity was included in separate models to determine any parity x treatment interactions. Cows from both treatments consumed the same amount of feed, but cows in the unpredictable group spent less time feeding and had a higher rate of feed intake. Cows in the unpredictable groups also visited the feed bins less often, consumed more feed during each visit, and were involved in more social replacements at the feed bin compared with predictable groups. Cows in the unpredictable groups had higher serum concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, but lower beta-hydroxybutyrate compared with predictable groups. Multiparous cows in unpredictable groups were more likely to be diagnosed with cytological endometritis after calving compared with cows in the predictable groups, but primiparous cows in unpredictable groups showed a tendency for the opposite response. These results suggest that an unpredictable and competitive social environment before calving causes changes in feeding and social behavior, some physiological indicators of metabolism and inflammation, and increases the risk of uterine disease in multiparous cows after calving.","author":[{"family":"Proudfoot","given":"K.L."},{"family":"Mamedova","given":"L.K."},{"family":"LeBlanc","given":"S.J."},{"family":"Keyserlingk","given":"M.A.G.","non-dropping-particle":"von"},{"family":"Weary","given":"D.M."}],"citation-key":"Proudfoot2018","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2017-14115","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"9309-9320","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Exposure to an unpredictable and competitive social environment affects behavior and health of transition dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-14115","volume":"101"},

It is unknown, however, whether the lower circulating α-tocopherol concentrations precede LDA or remain after LDA. Using a nested case-control design, blood samples taken at d -21, -14, -7, -3, -1, 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 49 postpartum from 7 multiparous Holstein cows diagnosed with LDA between d 6 and 32 postpartum and 10 healthy Holstein cows from the same herd were analyzed for serum concentrations of α-tocopherol and indicators of energy and nutrient status and inflammation. In addition to indicators of negative energy balance and inflammation, lower serum α-tocopherol concentrations preceded LDA and persisted after LDA correction. At the last blood sampling before LDA diagnosis, cows had serum α-tocopherol concentrations 45% lower (5.0 ± 0.9 vs. 9.1 ± 0.9 μM) and α-tocopherol to cholesterol molar ratios 39% lower (1.90 ± 0.19 vs. 3.09 ± 0.26) than those of healthy cows. Serum α-tocopherol concentrations remained lower (<10 vs. ∼15 μM) up to d 49 postpartum in cows that had LDA.

  {"id":"Queiroz2012","abstract":"This project aimed to determine effects of applying an inoculant containing homofermentative and heterofermentative bacteria on the fermentation, nutritive value, aerobic stability, and nutrient losses from corn silage produced in farm-scale silos. Corn forage was harvested at 34% dry matter (DM) and treated without (control) or with 5 × 10⁵ cfu/g of Lactobacillus buchneri and Pediococcus pentosaceus. The inoculant was sprayed on alternate 8-row-wide swaths of forage, and the untreated and inoculated forages were alternately packed into 3.6-m-wide bag silos. Forty-five tonnes of corn forage were packed into each of 4 replicate bags per treatment and ensiled for 166 d. Silage removed from the bags (500 kg/d) was separated into good and spoiled (visibly moldy or darker) silage portions, and weighed for 35 d. Weekly composites were analyzed for chemical composition, aerobic stability, and fungal counts. Aerobic stability was measured using data loggers that recorded sample and ambient temperature every 30 min for 7 d. Inoculation did not affect the chemical composition of the spoiled or good silage but decreased the quantity (5.7 vs. 12.9 kg/d) and percentage (3.4 vs. 7.8) of spoiled silage in the bags by over 50%. Losses of crude protein (0.28 vs. 0.92 kg/d), gross energy (6.0 × 10⁴ vs. 1.8 × 10⁵ kJ/d), and neutral detergent fiber (1.34 vs. 4.12 kg/d) in spoiled silage were less in inoculated versus control silages. Inoculated silages had lower pH (3.91 vs. 3.99), lactate concentration (7.63 vs. 7.86%), lactate:acetate ratio (1.58 vs. 2.53%), and a greater acetate (5.11 vs. 3.56%) concentration than the control silage. Inoculated silages tended to have fewer yeasts (2.59 vs. 4.62 log cfu/g) than control silages, but aerobic stability was not different across treatments (14.7 vs. 9.5 h). Applying the inoculant made the fermentation more heterolactic, inhibited the growth of yeasts, and substantially reduced the amount of spoilage and the associated energy and nutrient losses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Queiroz","given":"O C M"},{"family":"Adesogan","given":"a T"},{"family":"Arriola","given":"K G"},{"family":"Queiroz","given":"M F S"}],"citation-key":"Queiroz2012","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2011-5207","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",6]]},"page":"3354-62","PMID":"22612969","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of a dual-purpose inoculant on the quality and nutrient losses from corn silage produced in farm-scale silos.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22612969","volume":"95"},
  {"id":"Queiroz2012a","abstract":"This project aimed to determine if a dual-purpose bacterial inoculant could mitigate potential adverse effects of increasing levels of rust infestation on the quality, aerobic stability, and safety of corn silage. Corn plants with no rust infestation (NR), or medium (all leaves on the lower half of the plant affected, MR), or high (all leaves affected, HR) levels of southern rust infestation were harvested at random locations on a field, chopped, and ensiled without (control, CON) or with a dual-purpose inoculant applied at a rate that supplied 1×10(5)cfu/g of Pediococcus pentosaceus 12455 and 4×10(5)cfu/g of Lactobacillus buchneri 40788. Each treatment was prepared in quadruplicate in 20-L mini silos and ensiled for 97 d. As the level of rust infestation increased, the concentrations of dry matter (DM) and neutral detergent fiber increased, whereas DM digestibility decreased by up to 16%. Control HR silages also had lower 24-h neutral detergent fiber digestibility (NDFD; 36.2% of DM) than CON MR (39.8%) or NR silages (38.1%). Inoculation increased the NDFD of NR (43.4%) and MR silages (45.7%) but not HR silages (33.0%). Concentrations of lactate and volatile fatty acids decreased with increasing rust infestation in CON silages, but this trend was absent in inoculated silages. In HR silages, inoculation increased aerobic stability by 75% (77.3 vs. 44h), and prevented production of aflatoxin (5.2 vs. 0mg/kg). The concentration of aflatoxin in uninoculated HR silages exceeded action levels stipulated by the US Food and Drug Administration. In conclusion, increasing rust infestation was associated with reductions in the nutritive value and fermentation of corn silage. Inoculation reduced adverse effects of rust infestation on the fermentation, increased 24-h NDFD of NR and MR silages, and decreased aerobic spoilage and aflatoxin production in HR silages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Queiroz","given":"O C M"},{"family":"Kim","given":"S C"},{"family":"Adesogan","given":"a T"}],"citation-key":"Queiroz2012a","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5431","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",9]]},"page":"5285-91","PMID":"22916933","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of treatment with a mixture of bacteria and fibrolytic enzymes on the quality and safety of corn silage infested with different levels of rust.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22916933","volume":"95"},

This experiment investigates the effect of feeding a novel marine-based rumen buffering product on milk production, milk composition and reticulo-rumen pH in dairy cows grazing perennial ryegrass-based pasture supplemented with concentrates. Three primiparous and twenty-one multiparous spring calving dairy cows (58 ± 12.6 days in milk) were blocked by parity (3.2 ± 1.56) and pre-experimental milk yield (36.0 ± 6.55 kg) and randomly assigned to three experimental treatments in a three-period crossover-design experiment. Dietary treatments consisted of Control; 8 kg of a commercial cereal-based compound, BUF1; control diet +70 g of a novel marine-based buffer (a mix containing only calcified seaweed and a marine source of magnesium oxide: see detailed analysis provided) and BUF2; control +140 g of the same marine-based buffer in a changeover design experiment. Experimental periods lasted for 35 d with 21 d for diet adaptation and a 14 d measurement period. In-dwelling reticulo-rumen pH probes recorded reticulo-rumen pH and temperature during d 58–63 (Period 2) and d 93–98 (Period 3) of this experiment. Cows fed BUF1 and BUF2 showed an increased milk yield of 1.20 kg/d and 1.07 kg/d respectively when compared to the Control diet (P = 0.004 and P = 0.012). There were increases in energy corrected milk yield (ECM) of 1.53 kg/d (P = 0.02) and 3.5% and 4% fat corrected milk (FCM) of 1.87 kg/d and 1.76 kg/d, respectively (P = 0.012), when cows were fed BUF2 compared to cows fed the Control. Number of minutes per treatment per day at reticulo-rumen pH < 5.8 and < 6.0 was significantly greater for cows fed Control compared to cows fed BUF2 (P<0.001). Results of this experiment suggest that supplementation with a novel marine-based rumen buffering product increased milk production and reduced the amount of time the reticulo-rumen was below pH 5.8 and 6.0 in grazing dairy cows supplemented with a cereal-based concentrate.","author":[{"family":"Rafferty","given":"D.

The control diet (CON) contained lignosulfonate-treated soybean meal (as a source of rumen-undegradable protein) and calcium salts of fatty acids (Ca-FA, as a source of energy). Diets 2, 3, and 4 contained ground soybeans roasted at 115, 130, or 145°C, respectively (as the source of protein and energy). Dry matter intake (DMI) tended to be greater for CON compared with the roasted soybean diets (24.6 vs. 23.3 kg/d). Apparent total-tract digestibilities of dry matter, organic matter, and crude protein were not different among the treatments. Actual and 3.5% fat-corrected milk yield were greater for CON than for the roasted soybean diets. Milk fat was higher for soybeans roasted at 130°C than for those roasted at either 115 or 145°C. No differences were observed between the CON and the roasted soybean diets, or among roasting temperatures, on feed efficiency and nitrogen concentrations in rumen, milk, and plasma. Milk from cows fed roasted soybeans had more long-chain fatty acids and fewer medium-chain fatty acids than milk from cows fed Ca-FA. Compared with milk from cows fed the CON diet, total milk fat contents of conjugated linoleic acid, cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid, cis-C18:2, cis-C18:3, and C22:0 were higher for cows fed the roasted soybean diets. Polyunsaturated fatty acids and total unsaturated fatty acids were greater in milk from cows fed roasted soybean diets than in milk from cows fed CON. Concentrations of C16:0 and saturated fatty acids in milk fat were greater for CON than for the roasted soybean diets. Cows fed roasted soybean diets had lower atherogenic and thrombogenic indices than cows fed CON. Milk fatty acid composition did not differ among different roasting temperatures. In summary, results showed that cows fed CON had higher DMI and milk yield than cows fed roasted soybean diets. Among different roasting temperatures (115, 130, and 145°C), soybeans roasted at 115°C led to higher milk production and lower DMI. Cows fed roasted soybeans, regardless of the roasting temperature, had more unsaturated fatty acids in milk. Using roasted soybeans in dairy cow rations could, therefore, improve the health indices of milk for human nutrition.","author":[{"family":"Rafiee-Yarandi","given":"H"},{"family":"Ghorbani","given":"G R"},{"family":"Alikhani","given":"M"},{"family":"Sadeghi-Sefidmazgi","given":"A"},{"family":"Drackley","given":"J K"}],"citation-key":"Rafiee-Yarandi2016","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2015-10546","ISSN":"1525-3198","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"5422-5435","PMID":"27085410","title":"A comparison of the effect of soybeans roasted at different temperatures versus calcium salts of fatty acids on performance and milk fatty acid composition of mid-lactation Holstein cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030216301709"},

A literature search was conducted to identify papers published from 1990 to 2020. Effect size for all outcomes was reported as standardized means difference (SMD) with 95 % confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was determined using Q test and I2 statistic, while meta-regression was used to examine factors influencing heterogeneity. The meta-analysis results indicated no effect of SFC inclusion on DM intake (SMD = -0.214; 95 % CI = -0.549 to 0.121; P = 0.210). Starch digestibility (SMD = 0.987; 95 % CI = 0.668–1.307; P < 0.001) increased and DM digestibility (SMD = 0.345; 95 % CI = -0.027 to 0.718; P = 0.069) tended to increase as SFC replaced FGC. In this regard, DM digestibility decreased with increasing DM and starch intake, and increased with increasing forage level and days in milk. Milk yield tended to increase (SMD = 0.195; 95 % CI = -0.021 to 0.411; P = 0.077) and milk protein yield and content increased as SFC replaced FGC, but milk fat yield and content decreased. Inclusion of SFC instead of FGC significantly decreased MUN (SMD = -0.332; 95 % CI = -0.659 to -0.005; P = 0.047). Replacing SFC instead of FGC did not influence the ruminal pH (SMD = -0.021; 95 % CI = -0.278 to 0.236; P = 0.871) and total VFA concentration (SMD = -0.092; 95 % CI = -0.359 to 0.174; P = 0.497), however, decreased acetate (SMD = -0.579; 95 % CI = -0.862 to -0.296; P < 0.001), isovalerate (SMD = -0.388; 95 % CI = -0.694 to -0.082; P = 0.013), and isobutyrate (SMD = -0.607; 95 % CI = -0.947 to -0.266; P < 0.001) proportion. Substitution of SFC for FGC decreased the rumen NH3 concentration (SMD = -1.005; 95 % CI = -1.341 to -0.668; P < 0.001). Egger's test showed publication bias was detected for rumen acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, acetate to propionate ratio, and NH3 (P < 0.1).

A significant (P < 0.01) variation of 70 and 100 g/kg in NBOMD and NDFD respectively was found among the different cultivar's untreated straws. Urea treatment improved NBOMD and NDFD by 80 and 100 g/kg, respectively, without differences between 3 or 4% levels of urea. The improvement in dry matter degradability (DMD) due to urea treatment was found higher in rice straw having lower DMD in untreated straw and was found to be negatively correlated (r = −0.87∗) with the digestibility of untreated straw. In another in vivo digestion trial on crossbred heifers, the organic matter digestibility (OMD), NDFD and digestible organic matter intake (DOMI) were found significantly (P < 0.01) higher in straw of Kasturi cultivar over that of Sita. In nylon bag studies, the soluble fraction a and degradation rate constant c were found higher for Kasturi straw over that of Sita. The DMI was dependent on fraction a (r = 0.98∗) and c (r = 0.97∗ at P < 0.05). In another study, nine straw samples of different cultivars were incubated for 48 h in the rumen of two fistulated animals fed on 4 different diets consisting of; I: Wheat Bhusa (WB) + Sorghum (S) + 1 kg Concentrate (C); II: S + 1.5 kg C; III: S + 200 g Sodium Bicarbonate (Bic) and IV: S + 450 g bic. The DMD, NDFD and ADFD of straws were significantly (P < 0.01) higher on diet II and IV than that on diets I and III. However, hemicellulose degradability was reduced on diets III and IV. Different straws of rice cultivars also differed significantly (P < 0.01) among themselves in their nutrient degradability. Bicarbonate-supplemented diets III and IV had significantly (P < 0.01) higher rumen pH over diets I and II. The zero h DM disappearance (solubility) of straws determined at 0, 1, 2 and 3 h post feeding differed significantly (P < 0.01). The initial pH of the straw was found to have positive effect on the degradability of NDF (r = 0.74∗ at P < 0.05), DM (r = 0.71∗ at P < 0.05), nylon bag solubility (r = 0.88∗∗ at P < 0.01) and acid insoluble ash (AIA) in NDF of digested (r = 0.81∗∗ at P < 0.01) and undigested straw (r = 0.71∗ at P < 0.05). However, rumen pH was negatively correlated (r = −0.75∗∗ at P < 0.05) with rumen nylon bag DM solubility and hemicellulose degradability (r = −0.81∗∗ at P < 0.01). Loss of DM due to 1 h hot water refluxing at pH 7.6 was found negatively correlated (r = −0.81∗∗ at P < 0.01) with NDF content of the straw.","author":[{"family":"Rahal","given":"Anshu"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Atharuddin"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Mahendra"}],"citation-key":"Rahal1997","container-title":"Animal Feed Science and Technology","DOI":"10.1016/S0377-8401(97)00045-X","ISSN":"03778401","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]},"page":"165-182","title":"Effect of urea treatment and diet composition on, and prediction of nutritive value of rice straw of different cultivars","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037784019700045X","volume":"68"},

  {"id":"raisanen2025","abstract":"The objective of this experiment was to estimate the bioavailability (BA) of rumen-protected (RP) His, RPLys, and 2 RPMet products using 3 in vivo methods: area under the curve (AUC), plasma dose-response (PDR), and fecal free AA (FFAA) methods. We used 8 rumen-cannulated cows in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square experiment with 16-d periods. Treatments were (1) abomasal infusion of water (control), (2) abomasal infusion of free His, Lys, and Met (FAA), (3) administration of RPHis + RPLys + RPMet1 (rumen-protected methionine protected with ethyl cellulose; RPAA1), and (4) administration of RPHis + RPLys + RPMet2 (rumen-protected methionine protected with a pH-sensitive polymer; RPAA2). On d 7 of each experimental period, a pulse-dose of water (control) or FAA were infused into the abomasum of the cows, or RPAA were placed directly in the rumen, and blood samples were taken from the jugular vein through a catheter 11 times over a 24-h period for the AUC method. Following the AA pulse-dose, infusion lines were installed into the abomasum for continuous infusion of FAA for the PDR method, or RPAA were fed from d 12 to d 16 and cows were fitted with urinary catheters for total collection of feces for the FFAA method. Fecal collection and blood sampling were conducted from d 14 to 16. Due to technical issues likely leading to unrealistic BA estimates, data for the PDR method are reported in the supplemental material. Relative BA based on the AUC method (computed as AUC of RPAA treatment plasma AA concentration divided by AUC of FAA treatment plasma AA concentration) was lower for RPMet1 compared with RPMet2 (43% vs. 61%) and was 45% (SEM = 3.35) and 72% (SEM = 5.99), for RPHis and RPLys, respectively. Rumen escape fractions of RPAA, estimated in a previous study using an in situ method, and digestibility data from the current study were used for calculations of BA for the FFAA method. Bioavailability based on the FFAA method was lower for RPMet1 (67%) compared with RPMet2 (91%) and was 87% (SEM = 0.71) and 75% (SEM = 2.75) for RPHis and RPLys, respectively. The relative differences in estimated BA based on both the AUC and FFAA methods between the RPMet products were as expected, based on literature, and data for all 4 RPAA products corresponded well with previously estimated BA using the FFAA method. The unrealistic data for the PDR method were likely caused by technical deviations from the original method (e.g., once-daily dosing of RPAA and inability to capture representative plasma concentration data with the sampling time points). Therefore, comparison of the PDR method with the AUC and FFAA methods were not possible in this study. Further comparisons are needed without deviations from the original PDR method. Variability in BA data and differences in estimated BA between the in vivo methods highlight the current challenges for accurate measurements of relative in vivo BA of RPAA products. Different protection technologies may call for different methodology to be used for BA estimations. Further research and standardization of in vivo BA methods are warranted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Räisänen","given":"S. E."},{"family":"Wasson","given":"D.

  {"id":"Ramirez-Ramirez2016","abstract":"Twenty Holstein cows, 12 primiparous and 8 multiparous, with (mean ± SD) 91±19 d in milk and 595±81kg were used in replicated 4×4 Latin squares to compare the effects of feeding conventional dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) and reduced-fat DDGS (RFDDGS) in combination with rumen-inert fat (RIF) on milk production and rumen fermentation; one square contained rumen cannulated animals for rumen measurements. In each 21-d period, cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatments (values on a dry matter basis): (1) control (CON) that contained 0% DDGS; (2) DG contained 30% DDGS; (3) RFDG contained 30% RFDDGS in substitution of DDGS; and (4) RFDG+RIF was similar to RFDG with the addition of 1.9% RIF. Unlike most practical diets in the dairy field, our diets had <22% forage neutral detergent fiber and >18.0% crude protein. Dry matter intake was similar across treatments with any form of DDGS averaging 26.0±0.6kg/d, whereas the CON diet resulted in less dry matter intake, 21.6±0.6kg/d. Milk yield tended to be 1.7kg/d greater for diets with either type of DDGS. Concentration of milk protein was greatest for the DG and RFDG diets, intermediate for the RFDG+RIF diet, and least for the CON diet, namely 3.22, 3.21, 3.12, and 3.07±0.05%. Reduced milk fat percentage and yield were observed when cows consumed the DG diet, 3.27±0.10% and 1.11±0.04kg/d, respectively, whereas these responses were similar among CON, RFDG, and RFDG+RIF, which averaged 3.68±0.10% and 1.22±0.04kg/d. The presence of trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid was only detected in milk from cows consuming the DG diet; similarly, concentration and yield of trans-10 18:1 were greater for cows consuming this diet. Rumen ammonia was similar across treatments averaging 27.0±2.1mg/dL. The CON and RFDG+RIF diets had similar mean pH, 6.1±0.11, whereas DG and RFDG resulted in lower pH averaging 5.79±0.11. No effect on total concentration of volatile fatty acids was observed; the overall mean was 121±4.11mM; molar proportion of acetate was affected by treatment resulting in 67.3, 63.2, 61.4, and 60.9±0.93mol/100mol for CON, RFDG+RIF, RFDG, and DG, respectively. Results from DNA sequencing showed that rumen bacterial community structure was relatively stable with minor changes at the family and genus levels; these changes may be associated with low starch diets, and hence reduced amylolytic bacteria populations. Feeding high proportions of RFDDGS resulted in greater dry matter intake with low risk for milk fat depression while supporting ruminal fermentation.","author":[{"family":"Ramirez-Ramirez","given":"H.A."},{"family":"Castillo Lopez","given":"E."},{"family":"Jenkins","given":"C.J.R."},{"family":"Aluthge","given":"N.D."},{"family":"Anderson","given":"C."},{"family":"Fernando","given":"S.C."},{"family":"Harvatine","given":"K.J."},{"family":"Kononoff","given":"P.J."}],"citation-key":"Ramirez-Ramirez2016","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2015-9712","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"1912-1928","PMID":"26805970","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Reduced-fat dried distillers grains with solubles reduces the risk for milk fat depression and supports milk production and ruminal fermentation in dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030216000515","volume":"99"},

  {"id":"Ray2013","abstract":"The objective was to evaluate the effect of dietary phytate P (Pp) supply on ruminal and postruminal Pp digestion and net disappearance of P from the lower digestive tract of lactating cows. Six ruminally and ileally cannulated crossbred lactating cows were used in 2 incomplete Latin squares with four 21-d periods (17d of diet adaptation, 4d of total collection). Dietary treatments were low Pp, medium Pp, and high Pp, and a high inorganic P (Pi) diet with the same total P content as the highest Pp diet but with P mostly from inorganic sources. The diets contained 0.10, 0.18, 0.29, and 0.11% Pp and 0.43, 0.48, 0.54, and 0.53% total P on a dry matter basis, with cottonseed meal used to increase Pp content. Ytterbium-labeled corn silage and Co-EDTA were used as particulate and liquid phase markers to measure omasal and ileal digesta flow. Omasal and ileal digesta were collected every 6h on d 20 and 21 and rumen contents were collected on d 21. Samples were analyzed for total P (molybdovanadate yellow method), Pi (blue method), and Pp (high performance ion chromatography). Phytate P and total P intake increased linearly with increasing dietary Pp. Ruminal Pp disappearance also increased linearly with dietary Pp but the magnitude of change was small. Small intestinal net disappearance of Pi was not affected by dietary Pp. Phytate P was hydrolyzed in the large intestine but its hydrolysis was not influenced by dietary Pp. Net disappearance of Pi form the large intestine did not vary with dietary Pp. Dry matter digestibility decreased linearly with increasing dietary Pp, as did apparent digestion of P, and fecal P increased linearly. Dry matter digestibility was higher for high Pi than for high Pp, likely due to the effect of cottonseed meal in the latter diet. Replacing a portion of Pp with Pi resulted in decreased P excretion but this effect was confounded with increased fecal dry matter for the high-Pp (high-cottonseed meal) diet. In lactating cows Pp digestibility was not negatively influenced by dietary Pp and fecal P excretion was regulated by dietary total P rather than by form of dietary P.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Ray","given":"P P"},{"family":"Jarrett","given":"J"},{"family":"Knowlton","given":"K F"}],"citation-key":"Ray2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5851","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",2]]},"page":"1156-63","PMID":"23245962","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of dietary phytate on phosphorus digestibility in dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23245962","volume":"96"},

  {"id":"reinersShortCommunicationLysine2018","abstract":"© 2018 American Dairy Science Association We conducted 2 experiments to determine lysine loss from 2 lipid-coated lysine products after mixing with silage. In our first experiment, we mixed 2 lipid-coated lysine products, crystalline lysine or crystalline lysine and amounts of lipid identical to amounts included in lipid-coated lysine products, with alfalfa or corn silage that had 2 different amounts of acidity. Lysine appeared to disassociate from lipid-coated lysine products in a nonlinear manner after mixing with either alfalfa or corn silage at different amounts of acidity. Additionally, silage source and acidity affected amounts of lysine released from lipid-coated lysine products after mixing. In a corresponding experiment, in vitro estimates of lysine available to ruminal microbiota after mixing with alfalfa or corn silage at different amounts of acidity were measured by ammonia release. In vitro measures were conducted with or without monensin to allow estimates of effects of monensin on amounts of lysine released from the 2 lipid-coated lysine products. It is unclear whether in vitro estimates of lysine fermentation from lipid-coated lysine are truly reflective of ruminal degradation of lysine from lipid-coated lysine because amounts of time needed to measure differences between different lysine sources were greater than typical estimates of mean ruminal particulate retention time. Nonetheless, monensin apparently reduced ammonia release from lysine, but ammonia release from lipid-coated lysine did not differ from crystalline lysine. Clearly, methods of manufacture together with physical and chemical characteristics of diet can affect amounts of lysine provided from lipid-coated lysine products to ruminants.","author":[{"family":"Reiners","given":"J.N."},{"family":"Held","given":"J.E."},{"family":"Wright","given":"C.L."},{"family":"Brake","given":"D.W."}],"citation-key":"reinersShortCommunicationLysine2018","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2017-13701","ISSN":"00220302","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"title":"Short communication: Lysine retained among 2 lipid-coated lysine products after exposure to alfalfa or corn silage with different amounts of acidity","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"Reis2012","abstract":"Two experiments evaluated milk production, serum progesterone and insulin, and reproductive performance of lactating Holstein cows receiving or not receiving Ca salts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), or receiving Ca salts of PUFA at different daily frequencies. In experiment 1, 1,125 cows randomly distributed in 10 freestall barns were enrolled. Barns were assigned randomly to receive a high-concentrate diet containing (PF) or not containing (control, CON) 1.1% (dry matter basis) Ca salts of PUFA. Diets were offered 6 times daily, whereas the Ca salts of PUFA were included in the PF treatment in the first feeding of the day. In experiment 2, 1,572 cows were randomly distributed in 10 freestall barns, which were assigned randomly to receive a diet similar to PF, but with Ca salts of PUFA included only in the first feeding of the day (PF1X), or equally distributed across all 6 feedings (PF6X). During both experiments, cows were artificially inseminated 12h after the onset of estrus. Once per month, cows that did not conceive to artificial insemination were assigned to a fixed-time embryo transfer protocol. Pregnancy was determined via transrectal ultrasonography 28 and 60d after expected ovulation. Pregnancy loss was considered in cows that were pregnant on d 28 but nonpregnant on d 60. During both experiments, feed intake, milk yield, and milk protein and fat content were recorded weekly. Blood samples were collected concurrently with embryo transfer. During experiment 1, feed intake was similar between treatments. Compared with CON, PF cows had greater milk yield (37.8 vs. 35.3kg/d), and reduced milk fat content (3.41 vs. 3.55%). However, PF cows had reduced pregnancy losses per service compared with CON (12.6 vs. 18.3%). Serum progesterone was greater and serum insulin tended to be greater in primiparous cows receiving PF compared with CON cohorts (4.50 vs. 3.67ng of progesterone/mL, and 10.4 vs. 7.5µUI of insulin/mL). During experiment 2, no treatment effects were detected for feed intake, milk yield, or milk fat, whereas PF1X cows tended to have reduced pregnancy losses per service compared with PF6X (14.4 vs. 18.4%). In summary, feeding Ca salts of PUFA to dairy cows increased milk production, did not alter feed intake, and reduced pregnancy losses per service. Further, the total daily amount of Ca salts of PUFA should be fed during the first feeding of the day to optimize its benefits on pregnancy maintenance of dairy cows.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Reis","given":"M M"},{"family":"Cooke","given":"R F"},{"family":"Ranches","given":"J"},{"family":"Vasconcelos","given":"J L M"}],"citation-key":"Reis2012","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5502","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",12]]},"page":"7039-50","PMID":"23040021","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effects of calcium salts of polyunsaturated fatty acids on productive and reproductive parameters of lactating Holstein cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23040021","volume":"95"},

The objective of this study was to evaluate intra- and inter-observer agreement and accuracy of a simple method to score DD lesions that is based on the inspection of cleaned feet in the milking parlor with a swiveling mirror and a powerful headlamp. The hind feet of 242 Holstein cows from 4 farms were inspected concurrently by 5 observers (to assess inter-observer agreement) during 2 consecutive milkings (to assess intra-observer agreement). This inspection was followed by an inspection of the feet in a trimming chute, considered to be the gold standard test, to test for accuracy. The reliability of the method was assessed using both the 5 M-stages scoring system (M0 to M4, M standing for Mortellaro) and a simplified M-stages scoring system in which the M3 and M4 stages are merged. As most disagreements concerned the M3 and M4 stages, performance was improved with the simplified M-stages scoring system. With this simplified system, the method had good intra-observer agreement [percent of overall raw agreement (PA)=80%, weighted kappa (κ(w))=0.71, and good inter-observer agreement (PA=77%, κ(w)=0.66)]. The agreement with the gold standard test was moderate (PA=69%, κ(w)=0.58). Considering absence versus presence of a DD lesion on a foot, the method had good sensitivity (0.90) and specificity (0.80). The time spent for inspection varied from 30 to 60s per cow. Inspection of cleaned feet with a swiveling mirror and a powerful headlamp in the milking parlor is a reliable, cost- and time-friendly method, which may be useful for both farmers and researchers, especially when the DD status of many dairy cows has to be evaluated concomitantly. The reliability of this method might be improved by using more precise descriptive criteria for the discrimination of each M-stage.","author":[{"family":"Relun","given":"a"},{"family":"Guatteo","given":"R"},{"family":"Roussel","given":"P"},{"family":"Bareille","given":"N"}],"citation-key":"Relun2011","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2010-4054","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"page":"5424-34","PMID":"22032365","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"A simple method to score digital dermatitis in dairy cows in the milking parlor.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22032365","volume":"94"},

Cellulose hydrolysis was improved by 2.1, 2.2 and 2.9, respectively, for xylanase, SSA and SSA/xylanase pretreated straw. Xylans from untreated and pretreated wheat straws were also solubilised with cellulases.

  {"id":"Reschke2017","abstract":"Background: Previous studies have shown a high prevalence of failure of passive transfer of immunity (FPT) in Swiss dairy calves. Objectives: To investigate risk factors associated with poor colostrum quality and FPT on Swiss dairy farms. Animals: Colostrum and serum samples from 373 dam-calf pairs at 141 farms. Methods: The gamma globulin (Gg) concentrations of the dams' colostrum and the calves' serum samples were deter-mined by electrophoresis. Potential risk factors were assessed by logistic regression of questionnaire data. Results: Prevalence values of 15.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.0–19.6%) for low-quality colostrum (<50 g Gg/L) in cows and 43.5% (95% CI, 38.4–48.8%) for FPT (serum Gg < 10 g/L) in calves were estimated. The main factors associ-ated with low colostrum quality included colostrum leakage before or during parturition and a time lag > 6 hours between parturition and first milking. The results confirm that the occurrence of FPT in calves primarily was influenced by the quality of colostrum, the amount of ingested colostrum, and the time between birth and first feeding. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: These results confirm a large potential for improvement in colostrum harvesting and colostrum feeding procedures in the study herds. Control for colostrum leaking intra-partum, early colostrum milking, and ensuring that the calves ingest a sufficient volume of colostrum within the first hours of life are measures that can be readily implemented by farmers to decrease the incidence of FPT without additional workload. C olostrum intake is of vital importance for the pro-tection of newborn calves against infectious agents during their first days and weeks of life. 1,2 Besides the time until first feeding after birth and the volume of colostrum ingested, 3,4 the immunoglobulin (Ig) content of colostrum also plays an important role in the success (or failure) of transfer of passive immunity. 2,5,6 A low colostral Ig concentration can lead to hypogammaglob-ulinemia or FPT, and consequently increased risk of infectious diseases for the calf even if the total amount of colostral Ig ingested (calculated from the colostrum Ig concentration in g/L and the volume ingested in L) appears to be sufficient. 7 The quality of the dam's colos-trum and the Ig concentration in her calf's serum have been compared pairwise in only a few studies.","author":[{"family":"Reschke","given":"C."},{"family":"Schelling","given":"E."},{"family":"Michel","given":"A."},{"family":"Remy-Wohlfender","given":"F."},{"family":"Meylan","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"Reschke2017","container-title":"Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine","DOI":"10.1111/jvim.14806","ISSN":"19391676","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"1563-1571","PMID":"28833573","title":"Factors Associated with Colostrum Quality and Effects on Serum Gamma Globulin Concentrations of Calves in Swiss Dairy Herds","type":"article-journal","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"Reynolds2008","abstract":"The extensive development of the ruminant forestomach sets apart their N economy from that of nonruminants in a number of respects. Extensive pregastric fermentation alters the profile of protein reaching the small intestine, largely through the transformation of nitrogenous compounds into microbial protein. This process is fueled primarily by carbohydrate fermentation and includes extensive recycling of N between the body and gut lumen pools. Nitrogen recycling occurs via blood and gut lumen exchanges of urea and NH(3), as well as endogenous gut and secretory N entry into the gut lumen, and the subsequent digestion and absorption of microbial and endogenous protein. Factors controlling urea transfer to the gut from blood, including the contributions of urea transporters, remain equivocal. Ammonia produced by microbial degradation of urea and dietary and endogenous AA is utilized by microbial fermentation or absorbed and primarily converted to urea. Therefore, microbial growth and carbohydrate fermentation affect the extent of NH(3) absorption and urea N recycling and excretion. The extensive recycling of N to the rumen represents an evolutionary advantage of the ruminant in terms of absorbable protein supply during periods of dietary protein deficiency, or asynchronous carbohydrate and protein supply, but incurs a cost of greater N intakes, especially in terms of excess N excretion. Efforts to improve the efficiency of N utilization in ruminants by synchronizing fermentable energy and N availability have generally met with limited success with regards to production responses. In contrast, imposing asynchrony through oscillating dietary protein concentration, or infrequent supplementation, surprisingly has not negatively affected production responses unless the frequency of supplementation is less than once every 3 d. In some cases, oscillation of dietary protein concentration has improved N retention compared with animals fed an equal amount of dietary protein on a daily basis. This may reflect benefits of Orn cycle adaptations and sustained recycling of urea to the gut. The microbial symbiosis of the ruminant is inherently adaptable to asynchronous N and energy supply. Recycling of urea to the gut buffers the effect of irregular dietary N supply such that intuitive benefits of rumen synchrony in terms of the efficiency of N utilization are typically not observed in practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Reynolds","given":"C K"},{"family":"Kristensen","given":"N B"}],"citation-key":"Reynolds2008","container-title":"Journal of animal science","DOI":"10.2527/jas.2007-0475","ISSN":"1525-3163","issue":"14 Suppl","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",4]]},"page":"E293-305","PMID":"17940161","title":"Nitrogen recycling through the gut and the nitrogen economy of ruminants: an asynchronous symbiosis.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17940161","volume":"86"},

Our objectives were to determine if a low-energy, high-fiber diet fed throughout the dry period improved metabolic status and production of dairy cows compared with a higher-energy diet or a 2-diet system, and to compare responses of cows and heifers to those diets. Holstein cows (n = 25 with 10 primiparous per treatment) were assigned to each of 3 diets at 60 d before expected calving. Treatment LO [40.5% wheat straw; 5.6 MJ of net energy for lactation (NEL)/kg of DM] was designed to meet but not exceed National Research Council recommendations for ad libitum intake from dry-off until calving. Treatment HI was a high-energy diet (6.7 MJ of NEL/kg of DM) fed for ad libitum intake from dry-off until calving. For the LO+HI treatment, the LO diet was fed ad libitum from dry-off until 21 d before expected calving, followed by the HI diet until parturition. After parturition all cows were fed a lactation diet (7.0 MJ of NEL/kg of DM) through 63 d postpartum. Dry matter intake and body weight were greater for HI cows prepartum, but not postpartum. When LO+HI cows were switched to the HI diet, their dry matter intake increased to match that of HI cows. Cows fed HI had greater gain of body condition before calving but lost more postpartum. Energy balance postpartum was higher for LO cows than for HI cows. Milk production, protein content, and protein yield did not differ among diets. Milk fat content and yield were highest for HI cows, lowest for LO, and intermediate for LO+HI cows. The HI cows had lower serum nonesterified fatty acids prepartum than either LO or LO+HI, but greater concentrations postpartum. Serum β-hydroxybutyrate did not differ prepartum, but was greater for HI than for LO or LO+HI postpartum. Serum glucose and insulin were lower for LO than HI and LO+HI prepartum; insulin was lower for LO and HI than for LO+HI postpartum. The LO cows had lower liver total lipid concentration postpartum than the HI cows and LO+HI cows. Primiparous cows generally responded to diets the same as multiparous cows. The LO+HI feeding strategy provided no benefit over the LO diet. Moreover, the high-energy diet, even when fed for only 19 d before calving in the LO+HI group, resulted in increased serum β-hydroxybutyrate and liver total lipid concentrations compared with LO.","author":[{"family":"Richards","given":"B.

  {"id":"Rico2014","abstract":"The effects of dietary palmitic and stearic acids on feed intake, yields of milk and milk components, and feed efficiency of dairy cows were evaluated in an experiment with a crossover arrangement of treatments with a covariate period. Cows with a wide range of milk production (38 to 65kg/d) were used to determine if response to fat supplementation varied according to production level. Thirty-two Holstein cows (143±61d in milk) were assigned randomly to a treatment sequence within level of milk production. Treatments were diets supplemented (2% of diet dry matter) with palmitic acid (PA; 97.9% C16:0) or stearic acid (SA; 97.4% C18:0). Treatment periods were 21d and cows were fed a nonfat supplemented diet for 14d immediately before the first treatment period. The final 4d of each period were used for sample and data collection. Milk production measured during the covariate period (preliminary milk yield) was used as the covariate. No interactions were detected between treatment and preliminary milk yield for the production response variables measured. Compared with SA, the PA treatment increased milk fat concentration (3.66 vs. 3.55%) and yield (1.68 vs. 1.59kg/d), and 3.5% fat-corrected milk yield (47.5 vs. 45.6kg/d). Treatment did not affect dry matter intake, milk yield, milk protein yield, body weight, or body condition score. Milk protein concentration was lower for PA compared with SA treatment (3.24 vs. 3.29%). The PA treatment increased feed efficiency (3.5% fat-corrected milk yield/dry matter intake) compared with SA (1.48 vs. 1.40). The increase in milk fat yield by PA was entirely accounted for by a 24% increase in 16-carbon fatty acid output into milk. Yields of de novo (3.2%) and preformed fatty acids (2.9%) were only slightly decreased by PA relative to SA. The PA treatment increased plasma concentration of nonesterified fatty acids (96.3 vs. 88.2μEq/L) and glucose (56.6 vs. 55.7mg/dL) compared with SA, but insulin and β-hydroxybutyrate were not altered by the treatments. Results demonstrate that palmitic acid is more effective than stearic acid in improving milk fat concentration and yield as well as efficiency of feed conversion to milk. Responses were independent of production level and without changes in body condition score or body weight. Further studies are required to test the consistency of these responses across different types of diets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",1,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Rico","given":"J E"},{"family":"Allen","given":"M S"},{"family":"Lock","given":"a L"}],"citation-key":"Rico2014","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2013-7432","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",2]]},"page":"1057-66","PMID":"24342689","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Compared with stearic acid, palmitic acid increased the yield of milk fat and improved feed efficiency across production level of cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24342689","volume":"97"},

  {"id":"Rico2014b","abstract":"A variable response to fat supplementation has been reported in dairy cows, which may be due to cow production level, environmental conditions, or diet characteristics. In the present experiment, the effect of a high palmitic acid supplement was investigated relative to a conventional Ca salts of palm fatty acids (Ca-FA) supplement in 16 high-producing Holstein cows (46.6 ± 12.4. kg of milk/d) arranged in a crossover design with 14-d periods. The experiment was conducted in a non-heat-stress season with 29.5% neutral detergent fiber diets. Treatments were (1) high palmitic acid (PA) supplement fed as free FA [1.9% of dry matter (DM); 84.8% C16:0] and (2) Ca-FA supplement (2.3% of DM; 47.7% C16:0, 35.9% C18:1, and 8.4% C18:2). The PA supplement tended to increase DM intake, and increased the yields of milk and energy-corrected milk. Additionally, PA increased the yields of milk fat, protein, and lactose, whereas milk concentrations of these components were not affected. The yields of milk de novo and 16-C FA were increased by PA compared with Ca-FA (7 and 20%, respectively), whereas the yield of preformed FA was higher in Ca-FA. A reduction in milk fat concentration of de novo and 16-C FA and a marginal elevation in trans-10 C18:1 in Ca-FA is indicative of altered ruminal biohydrogenation and increased risk of milk fat depression. No effect of treatment on plasma insulin was observed. A treatment by time interaction was detected for plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), which tended to be higher in Ca-FA than in PA before feeding.

  {"id":"Rico2017","abstract":"Reduced insulin action develops naturally during the peripartum to ensure maternal nutrient delivery to the fetus and neonate. However, increased insulin resistance can facilitate excessive lipolysis which in turn promotes metabolic disease in overweight dairy cattle. Increased fatty acid availability favors the accumulation of the sphingolipid ceramide and is implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, however, the relationship between sphingolipid metabolism and insulin resistance during the peripartum remains largely unknown. Our objectives were to characterize temporal responses in plasma and tissue sphingolipids in lean and overweight peripartal cows and to establish the relationships between sphingolipid supply and lipolysis, hepatic lipid deposition, and systemic insulin action. Twenty-one multiparous lean and overweight Holstein cows were enrolled in a longitudinal study spanning the transition from gestation to lactation (d -21 to 21, relative to parturition). Plasma, liver, and skeletal muscle samples were obtained, and sphingolipids were profiled using LC/MS/MS. Insulin sensitivity was assessed utilizing intravenous insulin and glucose challenges. Our results demonstrated the following: first, insulin resistance develops postpartum concurrently with increased lipolysis and hepatic lipid accumulation; second, ceramides and glycosylated ceramides accumulate during the transition from gestation to lactation and are further elevated in overweight cows; third, ceramide accrual is associated with lipolysis and liver lipid accumulation, and C16:0- and C24:0-ceramide are inversely associated with systemic insulin sensitivity postpartum; fourth, plasma sphingomyelin, a potential source of ceramides reaches a nadir at parturition and is closely associated with feed intake; fifth, select sphingomyelins are lower in the plasma of overweight cows during the peripartal period. Our results demonstrate that dynamic changes occur in peripartal sphingolipids that are influenced by adiposity, and are associated with the onset of peripartal insulin resistance. These observations are in agreement with a putative potential role for sphingolipids in facilitating the physiological adaptations of peripartum.","author":[{"family":"Rico","given":"J.

Research on feeding management in more competitive free-stall settings indicates that frequency of delivery of fresh feed stimulates feed bunk attendance and can affect other aspects of cows’ time budgets apart from feeding such as time spent standing vs. lying down. The objective of this study was to examine how the frequency of feed delivery affects the behavior in two farms, one with a conventional and one with automatic milking system (AMS). The feeding frequency was varied from two to three times per day in the conventional dairy farm; one to two times per day in the AMS farm. The experiment was carried out in two different seasons. All behaviours of the cows were monitored in continuous by video recording. As expected, behavioral indices have been significantly affected by environmental conditions both in conventional farm and AMS farm. The variation in the frequency of feed delivery seems to affect the cow behavioural activity only in a limited way and modify only slightly the daily averages of the time spent in different activities mainly increasing the time cows spend standing (+4- 5%).","author":[{"family":"Riva","given":"E."},{"family":"Mattachini","given":"G."},{"family":"Bava","given":"L."},{"family":"Sandrucci","given":"A."},{"family":"Tamburini","given":"A."},{"family":"Provolo","given":"G."}],"citation-key":"Riva2013","container-title":"Journal of Agricultural Engineering","DOI":"10.4081/jae.2013.(s1):e39","ISSN":"22396268","issue":"2005","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"197-202","title":"Influence of feed delivery frequency on behavioural activity of dairy cows in freestall barns","type":"article-journal","volume":"44"},

  {"id":"Rodney2015","abstract":"Evidence is increasing of positive effects of feeding fats during transition on fertility and the adaptation to lactation. This study used meta-analytic methods to explore the effects of including fats in the transition diet on the risk of pregnancy to service (proportion pregnant) and calving to pregnancy interval. Meta-analysis was used to integrate smaller studies and increase the statistical power over that of any single study and explore new hypotheses. We explored the effect of fats and diet composition on fertility using meta-regression methods. Relatively few highly controlled studies are available providing detailed descriptions of the diets used that examined interactions between fat nutrition and reproductive outcomes. Only 17 studies containing 26 comparisons were suitable for inclusion in statistical evaluations. Reproductive variables evaluated were risk of pregnancy (proportion pregnant), primarily to first service, and calving to pregnancy interval. Production variables examined were milk yield, milk composition, and body weight. The sources of heterogeneity in these studies were also explored. A 27% overall increase in pregnancy to service was observed (relative risk=1.27; 95% confidence interval Knapp Hartung 1.09 to 1.45), and results were relatively consistent (I2=19.9%). A strong indication of a reduction in calving to pregnancy interval was also identified, which was consistent across studies (I2=0.0%), supporting a conclusion that, overall, the inclusion of fats does improve fertility. Further exploration of the factors contributing to proportion pregnant using bivariate meta-regression identified variables that reflected changes in diet composition or animal response resulting from inclusion of the fat interventions in the experimental diets fed. Increased fermentable neutral detergent fiber and soluble fiber intakes increased the proportion pregnant, whereas increased milk yield of the treatment group decreased this measure. Unexpectedly, the estimated energy costs of urea production also had a positive association with proportion pregnant. The limited number of suitable studies for the analysis highlights the need for more work to improve understanding of the critical nutritional factors affecting fertility. These factors include specific fatty acids in dietary interventions that contribute to increasing fertility of cows in dairy production systems.","author":[{"family":"Rodney","given":"R.M."},{"family":"Celi","given":"P."},{"family":"Scott","given":"W."},{"family":"Breinhild","given":"K."},{"family":"Lean","given":"I.J."}],"citation-key":"Rodney2015","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2015-9528","ISBN":"1525-3198 (Electronic)\\r0022-0302 (Linking)","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"5601-5620","PMID":"26094218","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effects of dietary fat on fertility of dairy cattle: A meta-analysis and meta-regression","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030215004233","volume":"98"},

The objective of this study was to characterize the clinical immune and metabolic responses to ruminal-derived lipopolysaccharide in nonlactating cows induced with SARA using 2 challenges, a grain-based SARA challenge (GBSC) or an alfalfa-pellet SARA challenge (APSC). Six dry, nonlactating Holstein cows were used in a 3 × 3 Latin square arrangement of treatments with 4-wk experimental cycles. All cows received the control diet containing 70% forage and 30% mixed concentrates (dry matter basis) for 3 wk. In wk 4, cows received a control diet, GBSC (38% wheat-barley pellets, 32% other mixed concentrate, and 30% forages), or APSC (45% mixed concentrate, 32% alfalfa pellets, and 23% other forages). Total plasma proteins and immunology-related proteins, acute phase proteins, blood cells, serum chemistry, mRNA gene expression of peripheral blood cell surface markers, and selected proinflammatory cytokines were evaluated. Ruminal pH was lower in both groups with induced SARA compared with a control group. Ruminal endotoxins were higher in GBSC; however, plasma endotoxin was not detected in any study group. No significant differences in feed intake, rectal temperature, white blood cell counts, or differentials were found between control and SARA challenge groups; changes in glucose, urea, Ca, and Mg were observed in SARA groups. Total plasma proteins were lower in both SARA groups, and acute phase proteins were higher in GBSC. The expression of CD14, MD2, and TLR4 mRNA in peripheral blood leukocytes was not affected by SARA induction. The induction of SARA as a result of GBSC or APSC challenge was successful; however, LPS was not detected in plasma. Changes in clinical, metabolic, and inflammatory responses were not observed in the SARA-challenged cows, suggesting that, in this study, SARA was not associated with a systemic response to inflammation.","author":[{"family":"Rodríguez-Lecompte","given":"J.C."},{"family":"Kroeker","given":"A.D."},{"family":"Ceballos-Márquez","given":"A."},{"family":"Li","given":"S."},{"family":"Plaizier","given":"J.C."},{"family":"Gomez","given":"D.E."}],"citation-key":"Rodriguez-Lecompte2014","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2014-8319","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"7777-7787","PMID":"25459907","title":"Evaluation of the systemic innate immune response and metabolic alterations of nonlactating cows with diet-induced subacute ruminal acidosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030214007103","volume":"97"},

The data base was 625 Holstein cows in second or later lactation fed diets primarily composed of corn grain and a combination of corn silage and alfalfa. Dietary crude protein as a percent of dry matter ranged from 9.5 to 20.2% and was varied with soybean meal. Exponential models were developed to predict changes in milk yield and dry matter intake per unit change in dietary crude protein. The consequence of changes in concentration of dietary crude protein on performance can be predicted with the models. The dose-response relationships can be used with relevant price information to estimate the concentration of crude protein that maximizes returns over feed costs. Profitability is improved by adjusting concentration of dietary crude protein for changes in the price of soybean meal.

Microsatellite markers (n = 182) were genotyped across the entire F2 population, all F1 parents and the paternal grandparents. Breed of origin of all chromosomal segments inherited in F2 progeny were predicted using GenoProb, where genotypic data, genetic maps and extended pedigrees were used as inputs. Statistical tests for quantitative trait loci (QTL) associations were conducted on 41 phenotypes with SAS using output from GenoProb for genotypic data. Fixed effects included sex and age at slaughter. For certain analyses carcass weight, RYR1 genotype and/or PRKAG3 genotype were also included as covariates. Subjective and objective measures of pork colour, marbling and tenderness were recorded, as well as measures of carcass fatness and muscularity. Test results were adjusted to a genome-wide level of significance. Five genomic regions presented significant evidence for QTL at chromosome 1 positions 6 cM (intramuscular fat) and 67 cM (Hunter L*), chromosome 2 position 62 cM (taste panel tenderness), chromosome 17 position 50 (loineye area and image analysis estimated loineye area) and X position 87 cM (carcass weight). Sixty-six suggestive associations were detected. Fourteen of these associations were within the regions with significant QTL on chromosomes 2, 17 and X, and the remaining 52 associations resided in 29 other regions on 13 different chromosomes of the porcine genome. The chromosome 2 region of 60-66 cM was associated with all measures of pork tenderness and the region on chromosome 17 (32-39 cM) was associated with both measures of intramuscular fat and loineye area. After verification, the QTL for marbling and tenderness should be useful in commercial production to improve pork quality as the population was developed from two of the three most utilized breeds of swine in the USA.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Rohrer","given":"G","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Thallman","given":"R M"},{"family":"Shackelford","given":"S"},{"family":"Wheeler","given":"T"},{"family":"Koohmaraie","given":"M"}],"citation-key":"Rohrer2006","container-title":"Animal genetics","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2052.2005.01368.x","ISSN":"0268-9146","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",2]]},"page":"17-27","PMID":"16441291","title":"A genome scan for loci affecting pork quality in a Duroc-Landrace F population.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16441291","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"ruckert2019","abstract":"Background: Pyrrolizidine alkaloids are secondary plant metabolites with hepatotoxic effect in humans and several animal species. In recent studies, foods such as herbal teas and honey have been found to be contaminated with pyrrolizidine alkaloids.\nObjectives: The aim of this study was to identify and assess pyrrolizidine alkaloids in compound feeds manufactured for horses and containing either alfalfa or a blend of herbs.\nMethods: Forty-eight feed products for horses were included in the study. The feedstuffs were analysed for 28 selected pyrrolizidine alkaloids by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The concentrations of the individual pyrrolizidine alkaloids were summed to calculate the total pyrrolizidine alkaloid content.\nResults: In 7 of 48 samples, pyrrolizidine alkaloid concentrations were below the limit of quantiﬁcation of 1–5 lg/kg. The median of 41 out of 48 samples was 58 lg/kg, and the 25 and 75th percentiles were 8 and 151 lg/kg. The highest observed pyrrolizidine alkaloid concentrations, 1306 and 1222 lg/kg, were found in two alfalfa-based feed products, followed by 836 lg/kg in an herb-containing feed product. Lycopsamine, seneciphylline, seneciphylline-N-oxide, senecionine and senecionine-N-oxide were the most frequently detected alkaloids. Main limitations: Risk assessment was based on no-observed-adverse-effect-level for pyrrolizidine alkaloids in rats and humans. The speciﬁc susceptibility of horses to pyrrolizidine alkaloids remains unknown.\nConclusions: According to our risk assessment, pyrrolizidine alkaloid contamination should be limited to <90 lg/kg in equine compound feeds. We showed a high rate of pyrrolizidine alkaloids contamination in feed products for horses. In 43% of the analysed samples, pyrrolizidine alkaloid levels exceeded the calculated maximum tolerable levels. There is a need to introduce measures to reduce pyrrolizidine contamination in equine feedstuffs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Rückert","given":"C."},{"family":"Emmerich","given":"I."},{"family":"Hertzsch","given":"R."},{"family":"Vervuert","given":"I."}],"citation-key":"ruckert2019","container-title":"Equine Veterinary Journal","container-title-short":"Equine Veterinary Journal","DOI":"10.1111/evj.13033","ISSN":"0425-1644, 2042-3306","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7]]},"language":"en","page":"495-499","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Pyrrolizidine alkaloids in commercial feedstuffs for horses","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://beva.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evj.13033","volume":"51"},

The ratio of these 2 was 1.3, suggesting a higher rate in the control group, but the ratio was not statistically significant (P = 0.34). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the effect of treatment group was not significant, although the coefficient suggested that predipping reduced the risk of clinical mastitis.

To allow inter-trial comparison which would have been invalidated by large differences between control treatments in LysDI and MetDI, milk production responses in terms of total yield, protein yield and content, fat yield and content, were expressed relative to new reference values calculated for the LysDI and MetDI concentrations (7.0 and 2.1% PDI, respectively), common for all analysed trials. Milk protein yield responses (dPY, g/d) were described by the following equation derived for lysine (LysDI): dPY=21.0{1-exp[-1.15(LysDI-7.0)]} R(2)=0.87, RSD=21.0, n=63 The equation describing responses to methionine (MetDI) was calculated for concurrent lysine concentrations greater than 6.5%PDI: dPY=34.1{1-exp[-1.90(MetDI-2.1)]} R(2)=0.81, RSD=11.7, n=37 The relationships obtained for protein yield could be used consequently to determine lysine (7.3 LysDI) and methionine (2.5 MetDI) allowances (%PDI), which optimise milk protein secretion in dairy cows and which conform to standard production conditions.

  {"id":"russello2022","abstract":"As herd size on dairy farms continues to increase, automatic health monitoring of cows is gaining in interest. Lameness, a prevalent health disorder in dairy cows, is commonly detected by analyzing the gait of cows. A cow’s gait can be tracked in videos using pose estimation models because models learn to automatically localize anatomical landmarks in images and videos. Most animal pose estimation models are static, that is, videos are processed frame by frame and do not use any temporal information. In this work, a static deep-learning model for animal-pose-estimation was extended to a temporal model that includes information from past frames. We compared the performance of the static and temporal pose estimation models. The data consisted of 1059 samples of 4 consecutive frames extracted from videos (30 fps) of 30 different dairy cows walking through an outdoor passageway. As farm environments are prone to occlusions, we tested the robustness of the static and temporal models by adding artificial occlusions to the videos. The experiments showed that, on non-occluded data, both static and temporal approaches achieved a Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCKh@0.2) of 99%. On occluded data, our temporal approach outperformed the static one by up to 32.9%, suggesting that using temporal data was beneficial for pose estimation in environments prone to occlusions, such as dairy farms. The generalization capabilities of the temporal model was evaluated by testing it on data containing unknown cows (cows not present in the training set). The results showed that the average PCKh@0.2 was of 93.8% on known cows and 87.6% on unknown cows, indicating that the model was capable of generalizing well to new cows and that they could be easily fine-tuned to new herds. Finally, we showed that with harder tasks, such as occlusions and unknown cows, a deeper architecture was more beneficial.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Russello","given":"Helena"},{"family":"Tol","given":"Rik","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Kootstra","given":"Gert"}],"citation-key":"russello2022","container-title":"Computers and Electronics in Agriculture","container-title-short":"Computers and Electronics in Agriculture","DOI":"10.1016/j.compag.2021.106559","ISSN":"0168-1699","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"106559","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"T-LEAP: Occlusion-robust pose estimation of walking cows using temporal information","title-short":"T-LEAP","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168169921005767","volume":"192"},

Treatments began at 28 days before expected calving until parturition and were: CON: DCAD = +6 mEq/100g of DM with low dietary Ca (46.2 ±15.2 g Ca/d; 0.4% DM; n = 26); ND: DCAD = -24 mEq/100g of DM with low dietary Ca (44.1 ± 16.1 Ca/d; 0.4% DM; n = 24); NDCA: DCAD = -24 mEq/100g of DM with high dietary Ca (226.6 ± 96.0 g Ca/d; 2.0% DM; n = 26). Vaginal discharge was evaluated through the fresh period via Metricheck (MC) for presence of purulent material. Polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell concentration in the uterus was evaluated at 15 and 30 days relative to calving (DRC). Endometrial tissue was harvested at 30 DRC for glandular morphology, presence of tight-junctions and adheren-junctions proteins, as well as assessment of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity. Blood plasma and serum samples were harvested in the prepartum and postpartum phase and were assessed for concentrations of lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), serum amyloid A (SAA), and haptoglobin (HP). Ovarian dynamics were assessed through the fresh period until first timed artificial insemination (TAI). Cows fed CON had a lower MC score (P = 0.06) than the average of cows fed ND and cows fed NDCA. Cows fed ND had a higher MC score than cows fed NDCA. Cows fed NDCA had greater uterine gland epithelial height (P = 0.02) than cows fed ND. Cows fed NDCA also had a greater number of epithelial cells per gland (P = 0.05) than cows fed ND. Cows fed NDCA had greater intensity of occludin expression (P = 0.15) than cows fed ND. Cows fed NDCA had increased activity of SOD (P = 0.05) and decreased activity of GPX (P < 0.001) than cows fed ND. Cows fed ND had higher plasma HP concentrations than cows fed NDCA in the prepartum (P = 0.01) and post-partum (P = 0.03) periods. Cows fed ND and NDCA had lower (P = 0.01) postpartum plasma HP concentration than cows fed CON. In conclusion, cows fed NDCA had an improved uterine environment most likely due to alleviation of oxidative stress, an enhanced immune response to parturition and uterine discharge comparable to cows fed CON.","author":[{"family":"Ryan","given":"K.T."},{"family":"Guadagnin","given":"A.R."},{"family":"Glosson","given":"K.M."},{"family":"Bascom","given":"S.S."},{"family":"Rowson","given":"A.A."},{"family":"Steelman","given":"A.J."},{"family":"Cardoso","given":"F.C."}],"citation-key":"Ryan2019","container-title":"Theriogenology","DOI":"10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.10.014","ISSN":"0093691X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","title":"Increased dietary calcium inclusion in fully acidified prepartum diets improved postpartum uterine health and fertility when fed to Holstein cows","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"saeed2018","abstract":"Vitamin A is required for important physiological processes, including embryogenesis, vision, cell proliferation and differentiation, immune regulation, and glucose and lipid metabolism. Many of vitamin A’s functions are executed through retinoic acids that activate transcriptional networks controlled by retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs).The liver plays a central role in vitamin A metabolism: (1) it produces bile supporting efficient intestinal absorption of fat-soluble nutrients like vitamin A; (2) it produces retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) that distributes vitamin A, as retinol, to peripheral tissues; and (3) it harbors the largest body supply of vitamin A, mostly as retinyl esters, in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). In times of inadequate dietary intake, the liver maintains stable circulating retinol levels of approximately 2 μmol/L, sufficient to provide the body with this vitamin for months. Liver diseases, in particular those leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis, are associated with impaired vitamin A homeostasis and may lead to vitamin A deficiency. Liver injury triggers HSCs to transdifferentiate to myofibroblasts that produce excessive amounts of extracellular matrix, leading to fibrosis. HSCs lose the retinyl ester stores in this process, ultimately leading to vitamin A deficiency. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and is a spectrum of conditions ranging from benign hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); it may progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer. NASH is projected to be the main cause of liver failure in the near future. Retinoic acids are key regulators of glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver and adipose tissue, but it is unknown whether impaired vitamin A homeostasis contributes to or suppresses the development of NAFLD. A genetic variant of patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3-I148M) is the most prominent heritable factor associated with NAFLD. Interestingly, PNPLA3 harbors retinyl ester hydrolase activity and PNPLA3-I148M is associated with low serum retinol level, but enhanced retinyl esters in the liver of NAFLD patients. Low circulating retinol in NAFLD may therefore not reflect true “vitamin A deficiency”, but rather disturbed vitamin A metabolism. Here, we summarize current knowledge about vitamin A metabolism in NAFLD and its putative role in the progression of liver disease, as well as the therapeutic potential of vitamin A metabolites.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Saeed","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Dullaart","given":"Robin P.

This further extends to patients with established osteoporosis. The mechanism underlying the blunted PTH response is unclear but may be related to magnesium (Mg) deficiency. The aims of this study were to compare in patients with established osteoporosis and differing degrees of vitamin D and PTH status : (1) the presence of Mg deficiency using the standard Mg loading test (2) evaluate the effects of Mg loading on the calcium-PTH endocrine axis (3) determine the effects of oral, short term Mg supplementation on the calcium-PTH endocrine axis and bone turnover.\nMETHODS: 30 patients (10 women in 3 groups) were evaluated prospectively measuring calcium, PTH, Mg retention (Mg loading test), dietary nutrient intake (calcium, vitamin D, Mg) and bone turnover markers (serum CTX & P1CP). Multivariate analysis controlling for potential confounding baseline variable was undertaken for the measured outcomes.\nRESULTS: All subjects, within the low vitamin D and low PTH group following the magnesium loading test had evidence of Mg depletion [mean(SD) retention 70.3%(12.5)] and showed an increase in calcium 0.06(0.01) mmol/l [95% CI 0.03, 0.09, p=0.007], together with a rise in PTH 13.3 ng/l (4.5) [95% CI 3.2, 23.4, p=0.016] compared to baseline. Following oral supplementation bone turnover increased: CTX 0.16 (0.06) mcg/l [95%CI 0.01, 0.32 p=0.047]; P1CP 13.1 (5.7) mcg/l [95% CI 0.29, 26.6 p=0.049]. In subjects with a low vitamin D and raised PTH mean retention was 55.9%(14.8) and in the vitamin replete group 36.1%(14.4), with little change in both acute markers of calcium homeostasis and bone turnover markers following both the loading test and oral supplementation.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that in patients with established osteoporosis, there is also a distinct group with a low vitamin D and a blunted PTH level and that Mg deficiency (as measured by the Mg loading test) is an important contributing factor.","author":[{"family":"Sahota","given":"O."},{"family":"Mundey","given":"M.

The main objective of this study was to compare the blood BHB measured in whole blood by the BHBCheck meter (PortaCheck, Moorestown, NJ) to a previously validated meter, Precision Xtra meter (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) and a colorimetric laboratory assay. Samples (n = 426) were collected from postpartum primiparous and multiparous Holstein cows (n = 79 cows) enrolled in 1 of 2 experiments (Exp) with different sampling schedules (Exp 1: n = 39 cows, 58 samples; Exp 2: n = 40 cows, 368 samples). In both Exp, whole-blood samples were collected from the coccygeal vessels after morning milking, before morning feeding. Blood samples were used immediately for BHB quantification via the BHBCheck meter and the Precision Xtra meter. Blood was also collected into evacuated tubes containing no additive (Exp 1) or potassium oxalate/sodium fluoride (Exp 2), which were centrifuged for serum or plasma separation and stored at −20°C for subsequent analysis. Laboratory quantification of BHB concentration was done by the BHB LiquiColor Assay (EKF Diagnostics-Stanbio, Boerne, TX; certified for serum and plasma). Data were analyzed by UNIVARIATE, CORR, FREQ, REG, and LOGISTIC procedures of SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Within this sample set, average parity was 3.3 lactations and DIM was 14 d. The proportion of samples classified as hyperketonemia (BHB ≥1.2 mmol/L) was 25, 28, and 31% as determined by the colorimetric assay, BHBCheck meter, and Precision Xtra meter, respectively. The correlation for BHBCheck meter BHB concentration compared with the colorimetric assay concentrations was r = 0.96, with a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 93%. Correlation, sensitivity, and specificity of the Precision Xtra meter concentrations were 0.97, 98%, and 92%, respectively. Bland-Altman plots demonstrated minimal bias for both meters. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve suggests adequate diagnostic accuracy of both meters. Overall, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the BHBCheck meter was similar to the Precision Xtra meter and laboratory assay, indicating the BHBCheck meter is appropriate for use as a cow-side diagnostic test for hyperketonemia in dairy cows.","author":[{"family":"Sailer","given":"K.

  {"id":"Salami2020","abstract":"Plant-based feedstuffs, such as soybean meal and rapeseed meal are utilised to supply rumen degradable protein (RDP) and rumen undegradable protein (RUP) in the diets of ruminant animals (e.g., cattle, buffalo, sheep and goat). The RDP is utilised by rumen microbes for microbial protein synthesis. Microbial protein can contribute up to 80% of the protein requirement of ruminants. However, the use of plant protein sources in ruminant diets can be restricted based on their availability, costs and associated environmental impacts. Slow-release urea (SRU) is a non-protein nitrogen (NPN) source that allows for a partial replacement of vegetable RDP sources in ruminant diets by providing a sustained availability of ammonia for rumen microbial synthesis. Over the past three decades, extensive research has been conducted on the use of SRU in beef cattle diets. The current study analysed a combined dataset obtained from multiple research studies to derive quantitative and research-based evidence on the impact of a commercial SRU (Optigen®) on beef cattle performance. Results revealed that dietary supplementation of SRU improves the performance, profitability and environmental impacts of beef cattle production. Thus, this study demonstrates SRU as an effective NPN solution in beef cattle diets. Slow-release urea (SRU) is a coated non-protein nitrogen (NPN) source for ruminant nutrition. This study applied a meta-analytic technique to quantify the effect of a commercial SRU (Optigen®, Alltech Inc., Nicholasville, KY, USA) on the performance of beef cattle. Data were extracted from 17 experiments and analysed using the random-effects model to estimate the effect size of SRU on dry matter intake (DMI), crude protein intake (CPI), live weight gain (LWG) and feed efficiency (FE) of growing and finishing beef cattle. There was no effect of feeding SRU on the overall DMI and CPI of beef cattle. Dietary inclusion of SRU improved the overall LWG (+92 g/d/head) and FE (+12 g LWG/kg DMI/head) of beef cattle. Notably, SRU supplementation in growing cattle exhibited a better improvement on LWG (130 vs. 60 g/d/head) and FE (18 vs. 8 g LWG/kg DMI/head) compared with finishing cattle. Moreover, SRU showed consistent improvements on the LWG and FE of beef cattle under several study factors. Simulation analysis indicated that positive effects of SRU on LWG and FE improved profitability through reduction in feed cost and reduced the emission intensity of beef production. These results indicate that SRU is a sustainable NPN solution in beef cattle production.","author":[{"family":"Salami","given":"Saheed A."},{"family":"Moran","given":"Colm A."},{"family":"Warren","given":"Helen E."},{"family":"Taylor-Pickard","given":"Jules"}],"citation-key":"Salami2020","container-title":"Animals","DOI":"10.3390/ani10040657","ISSN":"20762615","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"title":"A meta-analysis of the effects of slow-release urea supplementation on the performance of beef cattle","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"salfer2019","abstract":"ABSTRACT An annual pattern of milk composition has been well recognized in dairy cattle, with the highest milk fat and protein concentration observed during the winter and lowest occurring in the summer; however, rhythms of milk yield and composition have not been well quantified. Cosinor rhythmometry is commonly used to model repeating daily and annual rhythms and allows determination of the amplitude (peak to mean), acrophase (time at peak), and period (time between peaks) of the rhythm. The objective of this study was to use cosinor rhythmometry to characterize the annual rhythms of milk yield and milk fat and protein concentration and yield using both national milk market and cow-level data. First, 10 yr of monthly average milk butterfat and protein concentration for each Federal Milk Marketing Order were obtained from the US Department of Agriculture Agricultural Marketing Service database. Fat and protein concentration fit a cosine function with a 12-mo period in all milk markets. We noted an interaction between milk marketing order and milk fat and protein concentration. The acrophase (time at peak) of the fat concentration rhythm ranged from December 4 to January 19 in all regions, whereas the rhythm of protein concentration peaked between December 27 and January 6. The amplitude (peak to mean) of the annual rhythm ranged from 0.07 to 0.14 percentage points for milk fat and from 0.08 to 0.12 percentage points for milk protein. The amplitude of the milk fat rhythm generally was lower in southern markets and higher in northern markets. Second, the annual rhythm of milk yield and milk fat and protein yield and concentration were analyzed in monthly test day data from 1,684 cows from 11 tiestall herds in Pennsylvania. Fat and protein concentration fit an annual rhythm in all herds, whereas milk and milk fat and protein yield only fit rhythms in 8 of the 11 herds. On average, milk yield peaked in April, fat and protein yield peaked in February, fat concentration peaked in January, and protein concentration peaked in December. Amplitudes of milk, fat, and protein yield averaged 0.82 kg, 55.3 g, and 30.4 g, respectively. Milk fat and protein concentration had average amplitudes of 0.12 and 0.07, respectively, similar to the results of the milk market data. Generally, milk yield and milk components fit annual rhythm regardless of parity or diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) K232A polymorphism, with only cows of the low-frequency AA genotype (5.2% of total cows) failing to fit rhythm of milk yield. In conclusion, the yearly rhythms of milk yield and fat and protein concentration and yield consistently occur regardless of region, herd, parity, or DGAT1 genotype and supports generation by a conserved endogenous annual rhythm.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Salfer","given":"I.J."},{"family":"Dechow","given":"C.D."},{"family":"Harvatine","given":"K.J."}],"citation-key":"salfer2019","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/JDS.2018-15040","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,1]]},"page":"742-753","PMID":"30447981","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Annual rhythms of milk and milk fat and protein production in dairy cattle in the United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030218310634/fulltext","volume":"102"},

A feeding trial was performed with 16 Holstein-Friesian dairy cows fed with a total mixed ration (0.18 mg Se/kg dry matter (DM)) either without Se supplement (Control, n = 5), or with Se from sodium selenite (Group SeS, n = 5) or Se yeast (Group SeY, n = 6). In Groups SeS and SeY, the Se supplementation amounted to an additional intake of 4 mg Se and 6 mg Se/d during gestation and lactation, respectively. The effect of both Se sources was characterised by milk Se and antioxidant levels, and the phenotyping and functional assessment of phagocytic activity of milk immune cells. Se yeast has been found to increase (p ≤ 0.001) the milk Se and antioxidant levels markedly compared to the control group. The experimental treatment did not affect the immune parameters of the cows. Lymphocyte subpopulations and phagocytosis activity of neutrophilic granulocytes were affected neither by the Se intake nor by the two different dietary supplements.

  {"id":"Sanchez-duarte2019","abstract":"A meta-analysis was conducted to compare the effects of feeding dairy cows conventional sorghum silage (CSS) or conventional corn silage (CCS) compared with brown midrib sorghum silage (BMRSS) diets on dry matter intake (DMI), milk production, and milk composition. Data from 9 published articles (1984 to 2015) were used to contrast diets with CSS (7 means comparisons; 104 cows) or CCS (13 means comparisons; 204 cows) versus BMRSS diets. Statistical analysis was performed using fixed or random effects models with the Metafor package of R (https://www.R-project.org). The degree of heterogeneity was measured with the I2 statistic, and publication bias was determined with funnel plots and Egger's regression test. Other sources of heterogeneity of response were analyzed through meta-regression. Estimated effect size was calculated for DMI, milk production, and milk composition. No evidence of publication bias was observed for any variable tested. The highest degree of heterogeneity (I2 = 41.5 and 72.6%) was observed for DMI among dependent variables tested in both comparisons, indicating that intake responses to silage type are rather inconsistent; in contrast, milk production had the lowest degree of heterogeneity (I2 = 0%), supporting the idea that the responses of this variable to silage type were very consistent across studies. Compared with BMRSS diets, cows fed CSS diets exhibited decreased milk production (1.64 kg/d), milk fat concentration (0.09%), milk fat yield (0.08 kg/d), milk protein yield (0.04 kg/d), and milk lactose yield (0.16 kg/d) and tended to decrease DMI (0.83 kg/d). Compared with CCS diets, cows fed BMRSS diets increased milk fat concentration (0.10%), but decreased milk protein concentration (0.06%) and tended to increase lactose yield (0.08 kg/d). Meta-regression indicated that days in milk affected DMI and milk production when CSS diets were compared with BMRSS diets, and DMI when CCS diets were compared with BMRSS diets. Additionally, the inclusion rate of silage in the diet and dietary neutral detergent fiber affected yields of milk fat and lactose, respectively, when CCS and BMRSS diets were compared. Overall, lactation performance improved when cows were fed diets formulated with BMRSS compared with CSS, but performance was not different for cows fed BMRSS and CCS diets. However, the small sample size may have influenced these results by increasing the margin of the error and, concurrently, the power of the meta-analysis. Results of this analysis suggest that additional research is needed to explore the effects of days in milk and the inclusion rates of silages in the diets when comparing BMRSS with CSS or CCS.","author":[{"family":"Sánchez-duarte","given":"J.i."},{"family":"Kalscheur","given":"K.f."},{"family":"García","given":"A.d."},{"family":"Contreras-govea","given":"F.e."}],"citation-key":"Sanchez-duarte2019","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2018-14552","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"419-425","PMID":"30415847","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Short communication: Meta-analysis of dairy cows fed conventional sorghum or corn silages compared with brown midrib sorghum silage","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030218310403?dgcid=rss_sd_all","volume":"102"},

  {"id":"Santiago2015","abstract":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of F1 (Holstein × Zebu) cows in lactation according to different levels of substitution of soybean meal for a protein equivalent non-protein nitrogen originated from slow-release urea (SRU). Eight F1 (Holstein × Zebu) cows in the first third of lactation, with an average milk yield of 12.7 kg (±3.1 kg)/day and a live weight of 552 kg (±30 kg), were used. The experimental design was composed of two simultaneous 4 × 4 Latin squares, with the following treatments: 100% soybean meal and 0% SRU; 66% soybean meal and 34% SRU; 34% soybean meal and 66% SRU; and 0% soybean meal and 100% SRU. Sorghum silage, used as roughage, was supplied together with the concentrate. Feed intake and digestibility as well as milk yield and milk composition were measured. The obtained data were subjected to analysis of variance, adopting a 5% probability level. No intake variable showed significant differences among the treatments, and the mean values for the intakes of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) were 18.35 2.62 and 5.85 kg/day, respectively. The results for apparent digestibility also did not show differences among treatments, with DM, CP and NDF averaging 58.16, 58.64 and 36.21%, respectively. Milk yield and composition were similar among the treatments. The average 4%-fat-corrected milk yield was 13.39 kg/animal.day. Intake, digestibility and milk yield and composition variables are not changed according to the substitution of the soy protein for slow-release urea. Thus, for average-milk-yield crossbred animals, this substitution depends on economic variables only.","author":[{"family":"Santiago","given":"Bruno Tadeu"},{"family":"Villela","given":"Severino Delmar Junqueira"},{"family":"Paula Leonel","given":"Fernando","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Zervoudakis","given":"Joanis Tilemahos"},{"family":"Araújo","given":"Raphael Pavesi"},{"family":"Machado","given":"Henrique Valentim Nunes"},{"family":"Moreira","given":"Leonardo Marmo"},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Tadeu Silva","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"Santiago2015","container-title":"Revista Brasileira de Zootecnia","DOI":"10.1590/S1806-92902015000500005","ISSN":"18069290","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"193-199","title":"Slow-release urea in diets for lactating crossbred cows","type":"article-journal","volume":"44"},
  {"id":"Santos2004","abstract":"Reproductive failure in inseminated cattle results from poor fertilization and embryo survival. Recent studies utilizing dairy and beef cattle indicate that fertilization rates are higher for nulliparous dairy and beef heifers and nonlactating beef cows than lactating beef and dairy cows and nonlactating dairy cows. Several factors affect fertilization rates, but the greatest impact was observed for high producing cows under heat stress, when fertilization was only 55%. Once fertilization has occurred, the fate of a successful pregnancy is then determined by the survival of the embryo and fetus. Losses of pregnancy are characterized by early embryonic death, which occurs prior to the period of corpus luteum (CL) maintenance in the cow at days 15-17 of the cycle, and late embryonic death, which occurs from CL maintenance to the end of the differentiation stage, at approximately 42 days of gestation. After 50 days of gestation, pregnancy losses are less frequent and characterize fetal death. Most pregnancy losses occur prior to the period of maintenance of the CL, but in high producing lactating dairy cattle, substantial losses continue to occur up to 42-56 days after insemination. Several factors affect pregnancy losses in cattle, such as compromised oocytes, which result in poorly developed embryos incapable of cross-talking with the endometrial epithelial cells, to inadequate uterine environment and infectious agents resulting in death of the embryo from undernourishment. Recently, studies have indicated that anovulation/anestrous, the metabolic status of the animal, some dietary ingredients, as well as occurrence of diseases, predispose the cow to experience embryonic and fetal death. Although some insemination protocols might impact embryo survival, when timed AI has been implemented properly, it has not influenced embryonic or fetal death in cattle. Improvements in reproductive programs in the future will have to focus on enhancing fertilization rates and minimizing embryonic losses to optimize conception rates in dairy and beef cattle.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Santos","given":"J E P"},{"family":"Thatcher","given":"W W"},{"family":"Chebel","given":"R C"},{"family":"Cerri","given":"R L","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Galvão","given":"K N"}],"citation-key":"Santos2004","container-title":"Animal reproduction science","DOI":"10.1016/j.anireprosci.2004.04.015","ISBN":"1559688173","ISSN":"0378-4320","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",7]]},"page":"513-35","PMID":"15271477","title":"The effect of embryonic death rates in cattle on the efficacy of estrus synchronization programs.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15271477","volume":"82-83"},
  {"id":"Santos2015","abstract":"Feeding silages with high concentrations of yeasts from aerobic spoilage is often implicated as a cause of poor animal performance on dairies. Our objective was to determine if a commonly found spoilage yeast, isolated from silage, had the potential to alter in vitro ruminal fermentations. A single colony of Issatchenkia orientalis, isolated from high-moisture corn, was grown in selective medium. The yeast culture was purified and added to in vitro culture tubes containing a total mixed ration (43% concentrate, 43% corn silage, 11% alfalfa haylage, and 3% alfalfa hay on a dry matter basis), buffer, and ruminal fluid to achieve added theoretical final concentrations of 0 (CTR), 4.40 (low yeast; LY), 6.40 (medium yeast; MY), and 8.40 (high yeast; HY) log10 cfu of yeast/mL of in vitro fluid. Seven separate tubes were prepared for each treatment and each time point and incubated for 12 and 24 h at 39°C. At the end of the incubation period, samples were analyzed for pH, yeast number, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility, volatile fatty acids (VFA), and fatty acids (FA). We found that total viable yeast counts decreased for all treatments in in vitro incubations but were still relatively high (5.3 log10 cfu of yeasts/mL) for HY after 24 h of incubation. Addition of HY resulted in a lower pH and higher concentration of total VFA in culture fluid compared with other treatments. Moreover, additions of MY and HY decreased in vitro NDF digestibility compared with CTR, and the effect was greatest for HY. Overall, the biohydrogenation of dietary unsaturated FA was not altered by addition of I. orientalis and decreased over time with an increase in the accumulation of saturated FA, especially palmitic and stearic acids. We conclude that addition of I. orientalis, especially at high levels, has the potential to reduce in vitro NDF digestion and alter other aspects of ruminal fermentations.","author":[{"family":"Santos","given":"M.C."},{"family":"Lock","given":"A.L."},{"family":"Mechor","given":"G.D."},{"family":"Kung","given":"L."}],"citation-key":"Santos2015","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2014-8683","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"2603-2610","PMID":"25622865","title":"Effects of a spoilage yeast from silage on in vitro ruminal fermentation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030215000387","volume":"98"},

  {"id":"sarramone2020","abstract":"The objective of the current study was to compare the effects of feeding corn dried distillers’ grains with solubles (DDGS), camelina expeller (CE), whole camelina seeds (WCS), or whole flax seeds (WFS) on milk yield and composition of lactating dairy cows. Four Holstein cows were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design with 21-d periods, including 14 d of adaptation followed by 7 d of sampling. Four isoproteic and isolipidic dietary treatments were formulated as follows: 1) 18 % DDGS; 2) 9.5 % CE; 3) 4.2 % WCS; and 4) 4.7 % WFS (dry matter basis). Pre-planned contrasts were established to compare: 1) the two by-products (DDGS rich in cis-9, cis-12 18:2 vs. CE rich in cis-9, cis-12, cis-15 18:3); 2) the two forms of camelina (CE vs. WCS); and 3) the two whole seeds (WCS vs. WFS). Differences were declared at P ≤ 0.05. Contrasts did not reveal any significant differences in dry matter intake (x =24.6 kg/d). Actual milk yield was greater for cows fed WCS (36.5 kg/d) compared with WFS (35.6 kg/d). Moreover, yield of fat-corrected milk was lower with CE (29.8 kg/d) than with DDGS (35.3 kg/d) or WCS (33.5 kg/d). These effects are in line with lower milk fat concentration when cows received CE (27.1 g/kg) as compared with DDGS (36.3 g/kg) or WCS (34.8 g/kg). Lower milk fat observed with CE could be explained by a shift from the trans-11 to the trans-10 pathway of biohydrogenation, leading to the production of more intermediates known to inhibit milk fat synthesis, i.e., milk fat concentration of trans-10, cis-12 18:2 was greater with CE (0.078 mg/g) than with DDGS (0.045 mg/g) or WCS (0.041 mg/g). The transfer efficiency, from the diet to milk fat (g secreted/g consumed), of total n-3 fatty acids was lower with CE (0.082 g/g) compared with DDGS (0.109 g/g) or WCS (0.106 g/g), but was not different between WCS and WFS (0.110 g/g). Finally, the transfer efficiency of cis-13 22:1 was twice greater with CE than with WCS (0.198 vs. 0.105 g/g). In conclusion, feeding CE had a negative impact on lactation performance, and more specifically on milk fat yield; an effect that could be explained by the great accessibility of the residual oil contained in this by-product and its consequent interference with lipid metabolism in the rumen. Comparison of WCS with WFS reveals that both oilseeds support similar production efficiency and gross milk composition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Sarramone","given":"J.P."},{"family":"Gervais","given":"R."},{"family":"Benchaar","given":"C."},{"family":"Chouinard","given":"P.Y."}],"citation-key":"sarramone2020","container-title":"Animal Feed Science and Technology","container-title-short":"Animal Feed Science and Technology","DOI":"10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2020.114697","ISSN":"03778401","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12]]},"language":"en","page":"114697","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Lactation performance and milk fatty acid composition of lactating dairy cows fed Camelina sativa seeds or expeller","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0377840120306015","volume":"270"},
  {"id":"Sarwar2003","abstract":"The influence of varying levels of urea and additives on nitrogen (N) retention and chemical composition of wheat straw was studied. The wheat straw was treated with 4, 6 and 8% urea and ensiled with 1.5, 2 and 2.5% of acetic or formic acid and 2, 4 and 6% of corn steep liquor (CSL) or acidified molasses for 15 days. The N content of wheat straw was significantly different across all treatments. The N content of urea treated wheat straw was increased with the increasing level of urea. The N content was higher in urea treated wheat straw ensiled with acetic or formic acid as compared to urea treated wheat straw ensiled without these organic acids. The N content of urea treated wheat straw was further enhanced when it was ensiled with CSL or acidified molasses. This effect was significant across all levels of urea used to treat the wheat straw. Nitrogen retention in urea treated wheat straw was decreased linearly as the urea level was increased to treat the wheat straw. The N content was increased linearly when higher levels of CSL or acidified molasses were used to ensile the urea treated wheat straw. Most of the N in urea treated wheat straw was held as neutral detergent insoluble N (NDIN). The NDIN content was increased linearly with the increasing levels of urea and additives. The neutral detergent fiber (NDF) contents were higher in urea treated wheat straw ensiled with acetic or formic acid as compared to urea treated wheat straw ensiled without additive. The NDF content further increased in urea treated wheat straw ensiled with CSL and acidified molasses. The entire increase in NDF content was because of fiber bound N. The hemicellulose content of urea treated wheat straw ensiled with CSL or acidified molasses was higher as compared to urea treated wheat straw ensiled with acetic or formic acid. The acid detergent fiber content of urea treated wheat straw ensiled with or without additives remained statistically non-significant. The cellulose contents of wheat straw was linearly reduced when urea level was increased from 4 to 6 and 8% to treat the wheat straw. This effect was further enhanced when urea treated wheat straw was ensiled with different additives. The results of the present study indicated that fermentable carbohydrates might improve the Nitrogen retention and bring the favorable changes in physiochemical nature of wheat straw.

The forage portion of the diets was kept constant at 27.5% corn silage and 27.5% alfalfa hay (dry matter basis). Diets were 1) 0% distillers grains products (control); 2) 18.5% DDGS; 3) 10% CCDS; 4) 20% CCDS; and 5) a combination diet of 18.5% DDGS with 10% CCDS. Diets 2 and 3 contained 2% fat from DDGS or CCDS, whereas diet 4 contained 4% fat from CCDS and diet 5 contained 4% fat from the blend of DDGS and CCDS. The diets were balanced to provide 17% crude protein with variation in acid detergent fiber, neutral detergent fiber, and fat concentration. Dry matter intake (21.5 kg/d) was similar for all diets. Milk yield (33.8, 36.2, 35.5, 36.0, and 36.0 kg/d) tended to be greater for diets 2 to 5 than for diet 1, whereas yields of fat (1.04 kg/d), protein (1.02 kg/d), fat percentage (2.94), and protein percentage (2.98) were similar for all diets.

Maceration has been shown to increase the field drying rate, to enhance the silage acidification rate, and to improve, in some instances, the dry matter intake or digestibility of forages fed to ruminants. In other instances, however, maceration has caused high losses and produced a low quality feed, especially under rainy or humid wilting conditions. The paper reviews various mechanisms proposed and several experiments carried out to evaluate field drying, power requirement, and feed value. Very intensive conditioning can be achieved by impact maceration followed by compression into a thin mat. Less intensive conditioning can be obtained with a small number of staggered rolls, without mat formation; such a treatment would be preferred in a more humid climate to minimize field loss.","author":[{"family":"Savoie","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"Savoie2001","container-title":"Canadian Biosystems Engineering / Le Genie des biosystems au Canada","ISSN":"14929058","issue":"678","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"page":"21-212","title":"Intensive mechanical conditioning of forages: A review","type":"article-journal","volume":"43"},

Nine multiparous Holstein cows (185 ± 31 d in milk; mean ± standard deviation) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 diets in a 3 × 3 Latin square design with 18-d periods (14 d acclimation and 4 d sampling). Diets were either control, where dietary forage consisted of a combination of corn silage, alfalfa hay, and native grass hay, or 1 of 2 teff diets (teff-A and teff-B), where teff hay [13.97 ± 0.32% crude protein, dry matter (DM) basis] was the sole forage. All 3 diets were formulated for similar DM, crude protein, and nonfiber carbohydrate concentrations. Control and teff-A were matched for concentrations of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) from forage (18.2 ± 0.15% of DM), and teff-B included slightly less, providing 16.6% NDF from forage. Dry matter intake, milk and component production, body weight, body condition score, as well as DM and NDF digestibility were monitored and assessed using mixed model analysis, with significance declared at P < 0.05. Treatment had no effect on dry matter intake (28.1 ± 0.75 kg/d). Similarly, treatment had no effect on milk production (40.7 ± 1.8 kg/d). Concentrations of milk fat (3.90 ± 0.16%) and lactose (4.68 ± 0.07%) were also unaffected by treatment. Teff-A and teff-B increased milk protein concentration compared with the control (3.07 vs. 3.16 ± 0.09%). Treatment had no effect on energy-corrected milk yield (43.4 ± 1.3 kg/d), body weight, or body condition score change. Additionally, treatment had no effect on total-tract DM or NDF digestibility. Results from this study indicate that teff hay has potential to replace alfalfa and corn silage in the diets of lactating dairy cattle without loss of productivity.","author":[{"family":"Saylor","given":"B.A."},{"family":"Min","given":"D.H."},{"family":"Bradford","given":"B.J."}],"citation-key":"Saylor2018","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2017-14118","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"5984-5990","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Productivity of lactating dairy cows fed diets with teff hay as the sole forage","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-14118","volume":"101"},

  {"id":"Schalla2012","abstract":"Measuring individual feed nutrient concentration is common practice for field dairy nutritionists. However, accurately measuring nutrient digestibility and using digestion values in total digestible nutrients models is more challenging. Our objective was to determine if in vivo apparent total-tract nutrient digestibility measured with a practical approach was related to commercial milk production parameters. Total mixed ration and fecal samples were collected from high-producing cows in pens on 39 commercial dairies and analyzed at a commercial feed and forage testing laboratory for nutrient concentration and 120-h indigestible NDF (iNDF) content using the Combs-Goeser in vitro digestion technique. The 120-h iNDF was used as an internal marker to calculate in vivo apparent nutrient digestibilities. Two samples were taken from each dairy and were separated in time by at least 3 wk. Samples were targeted to be taken within 7d of Dairy Herd Improvement (DHI) herd testing. Approved DHI testers measured individual cow milk weights as well as fat and protein concentrations. Individual cow records were averaged by pen corresponding to the total mixed ration and fecal samples. Formulated diet and dry matter intake (DMI) records for each respective pen were also collected. Mixed model regression analysis with dairy specified as a random effect was used to relate explanatory variables (diet nutrient concentrations, formulated DMI, in vivo apparent nutrient digestibilities, and fecal nutrient concentrations) to milk production measures. Dry matter intake, organic matter (OM) digestibility, fecal crude protein (CP) concentration, and fecal ether extract concentration were related to milk, energy-corrected milk, and fat yields. Milk protein concentration was related to CP digestibility, and milk protein yield was related to DMI, OM digestibility, CP digestibility, and ether extract digestibility. Although many studies have related DMI and OM digestibility to milk production under controlled experimental settings, very few have related practical in vivo measures to milk production. By documenting the practical OM digestibility relationship with milk production, nutritionists and scientists may have confidence in this approach for measuring diet performance and collecting nutritional data for commercial dairies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Schalla","given":"a"},{"family":"Meyer","given":"L"},{"family":"Meyer","given":"Z"},{"family":"Onetti","given":"S"},{"family":"Schultz","given":"a"},{"family":"Goeser","given":"J"}],"citation-key":"Schalla2012","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5650","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",9]]},"page":"5109-14","PMID":"22916916","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Hot topic: apparent total-tract nutrient digestibilities measured commercially using 120-hour in vitro indigestible neutral detergent fiber as a marker are related to commercial dairy cattle performance.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22916916","volume":"95"},

Feed additives, which bind endotoxins in the gastrointestinal tract of animals, could help to prevent their negative impact. The objective of our study was to determine the potential of a bentonite (Bentonite 1), a sodium bentonite (Bentonite 2), a chemically treated smectite (Organoclay 1) and a modified attapulgite (Organoclay 2) to bind endotoxins in vitro. Polymyxin B served as positive control. The kinetic chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte lysate test was adapted to measure endotoxin activity. Firstly, a single sorption experiment (10 endotoxin units/mL (EU/mL)) was performed. Polymyxin B and organoclays showed 100% binding efficiency. Secondly, the adsorption efficiency of sorbents in aqueous solution with increasing endotoxin concentrations (2,450 - 51,700 EU/mL) was investigated. Organoclay 1 (0.1%) showed a good binding efficiency in aqueous solution (average 81%), whereas Bentonite 1 (0.1%) obtained a lower binding efficiency (21-54%). The following absorbent capacities were calculated in highest endotoxin concentration: 5.59 mg/g (Organoclay 1) > 3.97 mg/g (Polymyxin B) > 2.58mg/g (Organoclay 2) > 1.55 mg/g (Bentonite 1) > 1.23 mg/g (Bentonite 2). Thirdly, a sorption experiment in artificial intestinal fluid was conducted. Especially for organoclays, which are known to be unspecific adsorbents, the endotoxin binding capacity was significantly reduced. In contrast, Bentonite 1 showed comparable results in artificial intestinal fluid and aqueous solution. Based on the results of this in vitro study, the effect of promising clay minerals will be investigated in in vivo trials.","author":[{"family":"Schaumberger","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Ladinig","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Reisinger","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Ritzmann","given":"Mathias"},{"family":"Schatzmayr","given":"Gerd"}],"citation-key":"Schaumberger2014","container-title":"AMB Express","DOI":"10.1186/2191-0855-4-1","ISBN":"2191-0855","ISSN":"21910855","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"1-9","PMID":"24383578","title":"Evaluation of the endotoxin binding efficiency of clay minerals using the Limulus-Amebocyte lysate test: An in vitro study","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"Scheet2006","abstract":"We present a statistical model for patterns of genetic variation in samples of unrelated individuals from natural populations. This model is based on the idea that, over short regions, haplotypes in a population tend to cluster into groups of similar haplotypes. To capture the fact that, because of recombination, this clustering tends to be local in nature, our model allows cluster memberships to change continuously along the chromosome according to a hidden Markov model. This approach is flexible, allowing for both \"block-like\" patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and gradual decline in LD with distance. The resulting model is also fast and, as a result, is practicable for large data sets (e.g., thousands of individuals typed at hundreds of thousands of markers). We illustrate the utility of the model by applying it to dense single-nucleotide-polymorphism genotype data for the tasks of imputing missing genotypes and estimating haplotypic phase. For imputing missing genotypes, methods based on this model are as accurate or more accurate than existing methods. For haplotype estimation, the point estimates are slightly less accurate than those from the best existing methods (e.g., for unrelated Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain individuals from the HapMap project, switch error was 0.055 for our method vs. 0.051 for PHASE) but require a small fraction of the computational cost. In addition, we demonstrate that the model accurately reflects uncertainty in its estimates, in that probabilities computed using the model are approximately well calibrated. The methods described in this article are implemented in a software package, fastPHASE, which is available from the Stephens Lab Web site.","author":[{"family":"Scheet","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Stephens","given":"Matthew"}],"citation-key":"Scheet2006","container-title":"American journal of human genetics","DOI":"10.1086/502802","ISSN":"0002-9297","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",4]]},"page":"629-44","PMID":"16532393","title":"A fast and flexible statistical model for large-scale population genotype data: applications to inferring missing genotypes and haplotypic phase.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1424677&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","volume":"78"},
  {"id":"Scherer2015","abstract":"The concentration of biogenic amines (mono-, di- and polyamines) in silage and in the rumen, body tissues and body fluids mainly depends on the crop at harvest, the ensiling process, the silage and the digestion in the animal. Both the synthesis and the chemical structure of mono- and diamines are well documented. The basis for their formation is proteolysis, a naturally occurring process during ensilage, comprising the enzymatic decarboxylation of amino acids by the action of plant proteases and peptidases and of enzymes of various lactic acid bacteria (LAB), clostridia and other genera. Recent research has already delivered detailed knowledge about proteolysis, but the biochemical effects of biogenic amines in ruminants, including their impact on dry matter (DM) intake (DMI) by influencing sensory characteristics or post-ingestive feedback of the feed has not been elucidated. Data on effects of biogenic amines on palatability and their possible impacts on animal performance are scarce. However, some studies have been performed concerning the influence of biogenic amines on DMI, mainly with the quantitatively most relevant amines histamine, tyramine, putrescine and cadaverine. Studies differed greatly with regard to type of administration (supplemented to silage, provided orally in capsules or infused in the gastrointestinal tract via ruminal cannulas), dosages (2-40. g amine/kg DM) and mixtures (single doses or various combinations of amines; combinations of amines with aldehydes, organic acids or keto-acids). Single doses and low-level doses showed no effect on DMI, whereas higher concentrations naturally not occurring in silage and combinations like histamine and formaldehyde revealed an appetite-reducing effect. Gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), a non-protein amino acid often classified into the category of amines has also been studied. The conflicting results in terms of the impact of GABA on DMI may result from the administration of non-protected versus rumen-protected GABA and the differing modes of action of the two forms in the hypothalamus. In this review the results of research into the effects of different levels of amines in silages from different crops and ensiling treatments including the use of additives as well as the consideration of possible reasons for variation in the concentration of amines in silage are evaluated. Approaches for elucidating the possible impact on ruminant feed intake and level of production are also discussed. For an overall understanding of amine formation during ensilage further investigations with emphasis on correlations between the impact of ensiling and storage conditions and extent of amine formation are recommended to reveal relations between cause and effect.","author":[{"family":"Scherer","given":"R."},{"family":"Gerlach","given":"K."},{"family":"Südekum","given":"K.

The hypothesis was that the anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgetic effects of the pharmaceutic agent would reduce systemic inflammation, resulting in improved metabolic and inflammatory profile, diminished incidence of metritis, and reduced expression of pain. A total of 500 cows (153 primiparous, 347 multiparous) from 3 different commercial dairy farms in the northeast of Germany were included in a randomized controlled clinical trial. Farms were preselected based on high haptoglobin concentrations in their fresh lactating cows. Cows were excluded if they had experienced dystocia, stillbirth, or twin birth, or if they showed any signs of milk fever, retained fetal membranes, or fever (>40°C). The cows were treated once with either FM (3.33 mg/kg) or a placebo as control (CON) through transdermal administration between 24 to 36 h postpartum (d 2). General health examinations were performed (daily from d 2–8 and additionally on d 15 postpartum), vaginal discharge was assessed using the Metricheck device (d 8 and 15 postpartum) and serum samples were analyzed for inflammatory and metabolic markers (d 2, 4, and 6 postpartum). Effects of treatment, parity, sampling day, and their interactions were evaluated using mixed effects models. Primiparous cows treated with FM showed lower serum haptoglobin concentrations (0.90 ± 0.08 vs. 1.17 ± 0.07 g/L; ± standard error of the mean) and higher serum albumin concentrations (35.5 ± 0.31 vs. 34.8 ± 0.31 g/L) on d 6 postpartum. They also had a lower risk for purulent vaginal discharge with or without a fever compared with CON cows on d 15 postpartum (odds ratio for CON vs. FM: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.26–2.00), and body temperature was lower throughout the first 15 d in milk (39.1 ± 0.11 vs. 39.2 ± 0.11°C). Multiparous cows treated with FM had lower serum β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations on d 4 postpartum (0.71 ± 0.05 vs. 0.78 ± 0.05 mmol/L) and d 6 postpartum (0.74 ± 0.05 vs. 0.80 ± 0.05 mmol/L). Regardless of parity, FM-treated cows were significantly less likely to abduct their tail from their body (14.3 vs. 23.6%) and show an arched back (27.9 vs. 39.7%) on the day after treatment compared with CON cows. It can be concluded that FM treatment slightly reduced inflammation and diminished the risk for metritis in primiparous cows, improved metabolic profile in multiparous cows, and reduced expressions of pain in all cows.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Schmitt","given":"R."},{"family":"Pieper","given":"L."},{"family":"Borchardt","given":"S."},{"family":"Swinkels","given":"J.M."},{"family":"Gelfert","given":"C.-C."},{"family":"Staufenbiel","given":"R."}],"citation-key":"schmitt2022","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/JDS.2021-20555","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effects of a single transdermal administration of flunixin meglumine in early postpartum Holstein Friesian dairy cows: Part 1.

The present study hypothesised that varying dietary protein concentrations would affect the growth performance and nutrient composition of BSF larvae across different life stages. To test this hypothesis, the effects of low (CPlow, 10% protein), medium (CPmed, 15% protein), and high (CPhigh, 20% protein) protein concentrations in isoenergetic diets were investigated on BSF growth from the juvenile to the adult stage, with six replicates per treatment. From day 10 (DOL, days-old larvae) onwards, larvae fed the CPlow diet had significantly lower live mass than those on CPmed and CPhigh diets, with reductions of 24 and 29% at 14 and 16 DOL, respectively, compared to CPmed-fed larvae (P < 0.05). This effect persisted through the prepupal and adult stages. Developmental time from egg to prepupa was shorter in the CPmed and CPhigh groups, resulting in larger prepupal and adult body sizes. Nutrient analysis revealed that larvae fed the CPmed diet had higher dry mass, protein, and amino acid mass at the prepupal stage compared to those on the CPlow diet, whereas fat deposition was increased in CPlow-fed larvae at certain developmental stages. This study demonstrates that both the nutrition of Hermetia illucens larvae and their life stage at separation are crucial for optimising their value as a feed source.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Schneider","given":"L."},{"family":"Kisinga","given":"B."},{"family":"Stöhr","given":"N."},{"family":"Stiem","given":"T."},{"family":"Cord-Landwehr","given":"S."},{"family":"Schulte-Geldermann","given":"E."},{"family":"Moerschbacher","given":"B.

The presence of rapeseed and rapeseed press cake were indicated by a thiocyanate concentration increase, mainly in sow serum. The diets with glucosinolates decreased the milk and piglet serum I concentration. Spot urine and faeces samples from sows eating the rapeseed-press cake diets had increased I concentration. The sows’ serum I and thyroxine did not respond to glucosinolates (Expt 1) or these diets caused an increase in concentration (Expt 2). Both these criteria seem unsuitable for the diagnosis of I status of adult animals. Glucosinolates and their degradation compounds may affect the thyroid and the mammary glands resulting in lower I milk transfer and higher renal and intestinal I excretion.","author":[{"family":"Schöne","given":"Friedrich"},{"family":"Leiterer","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Hartung","given":"Horst"},{"family":"Jahreis","given":"Gerhard"},{"family":"Tischendorf","given":"Frank"}],"citation-key":"Schone2001","container-title":"British Journal of Nutrition","DOI":"10.1079/bjn2001326","ISSN":"0007-1145","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"page":"659-670","PMID":"11430770","title":"Rapeseed glucosinolates and iodine in sows affect the milk iodine concentration and the iodine status of piglets","type":"article-journal","volume":"85"},

  {"id":"Schouten2005","abstract":"Recent studies have highlighted the dangers of using haplotypes reconstructed directly from population data for a fine-scale mapping analysis. Family data may help resolve ambiguity, yet can be costly to obtain. This study is concerned with the following question: How much family data (if any) should be used to facilitate haplotype reconstruction in a population study? We conduct a simulation study to evaluate how changes in family information can affect the accuracy of haplotype frequency estimates and phase reconstruction. To reconstruct haplotypes, we introduce an EM-based algorithm that can efficiently accommodate unrelated individuals, parent-child trios, and arbitrarily large half-sib pedigrees. Simulations are conducted for a diverse set of haplotype frequency distributions, all of which have been previously published in empirical studies. A wide variety of important results regarding the effectiveness of using pedigree data in a population study are presented in a coherent, unified framework. Insight into the different properties of the haplotype frequency distribution that can influence experimental design is provided. We show that a preliminary estimate of the haplotype frequency distribution can be valuable in large population studies with fixed resources.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Schouten","given":"Michael T"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Christopher K I"},{"family":"Haley","given":"Chris S"}],"citation-key":"Schouten2005","container-title":"Genetics","DOI":"10.1534/genetics.105.042762","ISSN":"0016-6731","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",11]]},"page":"1321-30","PMID":"15944347","title":"The impact of using related individuals for haplotype reconstruction in population studies.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1456835&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","volume":"171"},

During the 21-mo duration of the study, 1,156 lactations from 809 cows were enrolled in 2 herds. During the first phase of the trial, all cows that were due to calve were vaccinated until approximately 50% of cows in the milking herd were vaccinated (at ∼6 mo). At that point, when 50% vaccination coverage was reached, cows that were due to calve were randomly assigned to be vaccinated or left as negative controls. Cure rate, rate of new infection, prevalence, and duration of infections were analyzed. Vaccination resulted in a moderate reduction in incidence of new staphylococcal IMI and a more pronounced reduction in duration of IMI associated with reduction of the basic reproduction ratio of Staph. aureus by approximately 45% and of coagulase-negative staphylococci by approximately 35%. The utilization of vaccine in combination with other infection-control procedures, such as excellent milking procedures, treatment, segregation, and culling of known infected cattle, will result in an important reduction in incidence and duration of intramammary staphylococcal infections.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Schukken","given":"Y H"},{"family":"Bronzo","given":"V"},{"family":"Locatelli","given":"C"},{"family":"Pollera","given":"C"},{"family":"Rota","given":"N"},{"family":"Casula","given":"a"},{"family":"Testa","given":"F"},{"family":"Scaccabarozzi","given":"L"},{"family":"March","given":"Ricard"},{"family":"Zalduendo","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Guix","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Moroni","given":"P"}],"citation-key":"Schukken2014","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2014-8008","ISSN":"1525-3198","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",5,29]]},"page":"1-15","PMID":"24881797","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","title":"Efficacy of vaccination on Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci intramammary infection dynamics in 2 dairy herds.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24881797"},
  {"id":"Schultz2013","abstract":"Digital dermatitis (DD) is one of the most important causes of lameness in dairy cattle worldwide. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of salicylic acid in the treatment of the disease. A total of 201 DD lesions from 173 cows from four commercial dairy herds were evaluated at day 0 during routine hoof trimming and were allocated into two groups, namely, a control group given chlortetracycline spray, and a treatment group given 10. g of salicylic acid powder applied topically within a bandage. Pain, lesion size and clinical appearance (scored M0 to M4) were evaluated on days 3, 14 and 34 post-treatment. A change to M0 was defined as healing, while changes of M2 or M4 to M1 or M3 were classified as clinical improvements. Healing rates did not differ significantly between treatment groups at days 3 and 14. By day 34 the healing rate was fivefold better (P= 0.01) for the treatment vs. the control group, with healing rates of 13.6% and 3.1%, respectively. By day 3, the rate of improvement was 2.5-fold better (P= 0.02) for the controls. By day 34 the overall positive effect (i.e. healing and improvement) was 1.75-fold better (P= 0.05) for the treatment group. Lesions from the control group were 2.2 times more likely (P= 0.09) to have a pain score equal to 2 by day 14. The proportion of lesions getting smaller by days 14 and 34 was 2.5 times higher (P< 0.08) for the treatment vs. the control group. The findings suggest salicylic acid should be considered as an alternative to chlortetracycline for the treatment of DD as it appears more efficacious and would assist in reducing antibiotic use. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","author":[{"family":"Schultz","given":"N."},{"family":"Capion","given":"N."}],"citation-key":"Schultz2013","container-title":"Veterinary Journal","DOI":"10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.09.002","ISSN":"10900233","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"518-523","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","title":"Efficacy of salicylic acid in the treatment of digital dermatitis in dairy cattle","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.09.002","volume":"198"},
  {"id":"Schulz2018","abstract":"© 2018 American Dairy Science Association This study aimed to evaluate the effect of replacing maize silage plus soybean meal with red clover silage (RCS) plus wheat on the fatty acid (FA) profile in the milk fat of cows. Forty-four lactating German Holstein cows were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design with 21-d periods composed of 13 d of adaptation to diets followed by an 8-d sampling phase. Experimental diets offered as total mixed ration consisted of a constant forage-to-concentrate ratio (75:25) with target proportions of RCS to maize silage of 15:60 (RCS 15 ), 30:45 (RCS 30 ), 45:30 (RCS 45 ), and 60:15 (RCS 60 ) on a dry matter basis. Increasing the level of RCS in the diet was accompanied by a reduction of linoleic acid content in the diet and decreased linearly the proportions of linoleic acid in the milk up to 4%. Proportions of α-linolenic acid in milk increased 2-fold with RCS 60 compared with RCS 15 , which resulted from the linear increase in α-linolenic acid intake with incremental levels of RCS. Vaccenic acid in the milk fat was reduced by 24%. Rumenic acid, a conjugated linoleic acid (cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid) considered to be a human health promoter, was also decreased by 22%. Reduced rumenic acid in the milk fat was probably due to a reduced amount of vaccenic acid produced in the rumen and, consequently, to the low amount of vaccenic acid to be desaturated to rumenic acid in the mammary gland by Δ 9 -desaturase. Oleic acid was enriched in the milk fat, although the dietary concentration of oleic acid decreased. Stearic acid proportions remained constant with increasing levels of RCS. The proportions of total polyunsaturated FA were increased by 12%, and the long-chain FA proportions increased linearly with increasing levels of RCS. Myristic acid was reduced linearly, but palmitic acid remained constant. Saturated FA was reduced linearly by 2%. Branched-chain FA, which are presumed to possess anticarcinogenic properties, were reduced to a small extent only (quadratic effect). We conclude that replacing maize silage with RCS appears to alter milk FA composition by reducing linoleic acid intake and ruminal biohydrogenation. Feeding RCS represents a strategy to increase intake of α-linolenic acid in dairy cows. However, because changes in the FA profile show positive as well as negative effects, no distinct conclusions can be drawn with regard to human health benefits.","author":[{"family":"Schulz","given":"Franziska"},{"family":"Westreicher-Kristen","given":"Edwin"},{"family":"Molkentin","given":"Joachim"},{"family":"Knappstein","given":"Karin"},{"family":"Susenbeth","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"Schulz2018","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2017-14335","ISSN":"00220302","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"1-12","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Effect of replacing maize silage with red clover silage in the diet on milk fatty acid composition in cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030218304995"},

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of replacing maize silage plus soybean meal with red clover silage (RCS) plus wheat on feed intake, diet digestibility, N partitioning, urinary excretion of purine derivatives, and milk production in dairy cows. Forty-four lactating German Holstein cows were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design with 21-d periods composed of a 13-d adaptation phase followed by an 8-d sampling phase. Experimental diets offered as total mixed ration consisted of a constant forage-to-concentrate ratio (75:25) with targeted proportions of RCS-to-maize silage of 15:60 (RCS 15 ), 30:45 (RCS 30 ), 45:30 (RCS 45 ), and 60:15 (RCS 60 ) on a dry matter (DM) basis. Increasing the proportion of RCS plus wheat in the diet decreased linearly the intake of DM from 22.4 to 19.8 kg/d, and of organic matter from 21.1 to 18.1 kg/d. The apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM and organic matter did not differ across diets and averaged 68.4 and 70.5%, respectively. However, ATTD of N decreased linearly from 68.5 to 63.2%, whereas ATTD of neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber increased linearly from 50.4 to 59.6% and from 48.4 to 57.7%, respectively, when increasing the proportion of RCS plus wheat. Fecal N excretion increased from 31.6 (RCS 15 ) to 37.2% (RCS 60 ) of N intake, whereas urinary N excretion was the lowest (32.8% of N intake) with RCS 45 . Hence, N efficiency (milk N/N intake) decreased linearly with incremental levels of RCS plus wheat, being the lowest when feeding RCS 60 (25.4%), probably due to increased nonprotein N proportion in total dietary N. Urinary excretion of purine derivatives decreased linearly from 378 to 339 mmol/d, which suggests that increasing levels of RCS plus wheat reduced the microbial crude protein flow at the duodenum. Milk yield and milk protein concentration declined linearly from 35.9 to 30.2 kg/d and from 3.20 to 3.01%, respectively, when increasing the proportion of RCS plus wheat. In conclusion, caution should be taken before introducing high levels of RCS plus wheat in diets of high-yielding dairy cows. However, RCS plus wheat can be included up to 30% of the dairy cow diet (DM basis) without a reduction in lactation performance.","author":[{"family":"Schulz","given":"Franziska"},{"family":"Westreicher-Kristen","given":"Edwin"},{"family":"Knappstein","given":"Karin"},{"family":"Molkentin","given":"Joachim"},{"family":"Susenbeth","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"Schulz2018a","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2017-13605","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"1216-1226","PMID":"12597864","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Replacing maize silage plus soybean meal with red clover silage plus wheat in diets for lactating dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002203021731158X","volume":"101"},

Eight (4 primiparous and 4 multiparous) ruminally and duodenally cannulated Holstein cows were assigned to 4 dietary treatments in a replicated 21-d period, 4 x 4 Latin square design with a 2 x 2 factorial treatment arrangement. Diets, fed as TMR, contained (DM basis) 2 levels of forage (35 and 60%) and 2 levels of NFC (30 and 40%). The forage portion of the diets contained 50% corn silage, 33% alfalfa hay, and 17% grass hay. Soybean hulls and beet pulp (2:1) and corn meal and ground barley (2:1) were included to achieve desired NFC concentrations. No supplemental B-vitamins were fed. B-vitamin AS was calculated as the amount of a specific B-vitamin flowing to the duodenum minus its daily orts-corrected intake. Dry matter and organic matter intakes were higher for cows fed the 35% forage diets and the 40% NFC diets. Increasing dietary forage content decreased ruminal AS of pyridoxine, folic acid, and B12. Increasing dietary NFC content increased ruminal AS of nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, niacin, pyridoxal, B6, and folic acid but decreased AS of B12. Across diets, amounts of B-vitamins synthesized were highest for niacin, followed by riboflavin, B12, thiamin, B6, and folic acid. Biotin AS values were negative for all diets, suggesting either no ruminal synthesis or that destruction by ruminal microflora was greater than synthesis. B-vitamin intake, duodenal flow, and ruminal synthesis are influenced by dietary forage and NFC contents.","author":[{"family":"Schwab","given":"E.C."},{"family":"Schwab","given":"C.G."},{"family":"Shaver","given":"R.D."},{"family":"Girard","given":"C.L."},{"family":"Putnam","given":"D.E."},{"family":"Whitehouse","given":"N.L."}],"citation-key":"Schwab2006","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72082-3","ISBN":"1525-3198; 0022-0302","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"page":"174-187","PMID":"16357281","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Dietary Forage and Nonfiber Carbohydrate Contents Influence B-Vitamin Intake, Duodenal Flow, and Apparent Ruminal Synthesis in Lactating Dairy Cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030206720823","volume":"89"},
  {"id":"Schwab2017","abstract":"Considerable progress has been made in understand-ing the protein and amino acid (AA) nutrition of dairy cows. The chemistry of feed crude protein (CP) appears to be well understood, as is the mechanism of ruminal protein degradation by rumen bacteria and protozoa. It has been shown that ammonia released from AA degradation in the rumen is used for bacterial protein formation and that urea can be a useful N supplement when lower protein diets are fed. It is now well docu-mented that adequate rumen ammonia levels must be maintained for maximal synthesis of microbial protein and that a deficiency of rumen-degradable protein can decrease microbial protein synthesis, fiber digestibility, and feed intake. Rumen-synthesized microbial protein accounts for most of the CP flowing to the small intes-tine and is considered a high-quality protein for dairy cows because of apparent high digestibility and good AA composition. Much attention has been given to evaluating different methods to quantify ruminal pro-tein degradation and escape and for measuring ruminal outflows of microbial protein and rumen-undegraded feed protein. The methods and accompanying results are used to determine the nutritional value of protein supplements and to develop nutritional models and evaluate their predictive ability. Lysine, methionine, and histidine have been identified most often as the most-limiting amino acids, with rumen-protected forms of lysine and methionine available for ration supple-mentation. Guidelines for protein feeding have evolved from simple feeding standards for dietary CP to more complex nutrition models that are designed to predict supplies and requirements for rumen ammonia and peptides and intestinally absorbable AA. The industry awaits more robust and mechanistic models for predict-ing supplies and requirements of rumen-available N and absorbed AA. Such models will be useful in allowing for feeding lower protein diets and increased efficiency of microbial protein synthesis.","author":[{"family":"Schwab","given":"Charles G."},{"family":"Broderick","given":"Glen A."}],"citation-key":"Schwab2017","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2017-13320","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"10094-10112","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"A 100-Year Review: Protein and amino acid nutrition in dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-13320","volume":"100"},

  {"id":"Seboussi2016","abstract":"Fertilization with Se improves forage organic Se concentration, but comparisons with other forms of Se supplementation in feeding lactating dairy cows are scarce. Our objective was to compare the effect of Se-enriched forages to dietary sources of inorganic and organic Se. Digestibility, retention, and balance were assessed by measuring Se concentrations in feces, urine, milk, and blood. The resulting effect on antioxidant status and lactation performance of dairy cows was also determined. High-Se silages (1.72 mg of Se/kg of DM) were produced following a spring application of 2.5 kg/ha of Selcote Ultra, whereas low-Se silages (0.05 mg of Se/kg of DM) were produced in the Se-unfertilized portion of the same fields. After a 77 ± 17 d period of Se depletion, 33 late-lactation primiparous Holstein cows were blocked and randomly assigned for 43 d to 1 of 4 experimental total mixed rations fed for ad libitum intake in an unbalanced randomized block design. Treatments consisted of 4 diets: control with low-Se silages, without Se supplement (0.12 ± 0.04 mg of Se/kg of DM); ISe with low-Se silages and inorganic Se (0.80 ± 0.14 mg of Se/kg of DM); YSe with low-Se silages and organic Se from yeast (0.70 ± 0.11 mg of Se/kg of DM); and FSe with high-Se silages, without Se supplement (0.79 ± 0.14 mg of Se/kg of DM). Organic Se, either as YSe or FSe, was more available and more effective to increase blood and milk Se concentrations than ISe. Moreover, FSe was more available than YSe, as cows fed FSe excreted 16 and 22% less Se (as percentage of intake) in feces and urine, respectively, had higher Se apparent absorption (17%), retention (37%), and balance (45%), and had greater concentration of Se in serum (16%) and milk (11%) than cows fed YSe. Antioxidant status (whole blood and plasma glutathione peroxidase, and milk thioredoxin reductase and malondialdehyde) was not affected by treatments. Dry matter intake, yield of actual, energy-corrected, and fat-corrected milk, as well as milk fat and lactose concentrations, were not affected by the dietary treatments. Cows fed ISe had lower milk protein concentration (3.44%) than cows fed YSe (3.58%) or FSe (3.51%). Cows fed Se-supplemented diets had a lower milk somatic cell count than cows fed the control diet. Results from the current study showed that the production of Se-enriched forages is an effective method to supplement dairy cows in Se as it was more available than YSe, and did not alter antioxidant status and performances of lactating dairy cows.","author":[{"family":"Séboussi","given":"R."},{"family":"Tremblay","given":"G.F."},{"family":"Ouellet","given":"V."},{"family":"Chouinard","given":"P.Y."},{"family":"Chorfi","given":"Y."},{"family":"Bélanger","given":"G."},{"family":"Charbonneau","given":"É."}],"citation-key":"Seboussi2016","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2015-10758","ISSN":"00220302","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"5358-5369","title":"Selenium-fertilized forage as a way to supplement lactating dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030216301771"},

  {"id":"Sejrsen2000","abstract":"Available evidence concerning the relationship between growth rate, mammary growth and milk yield in heifers leads to these conclusions: 1) Increased growth rate due to high feeding level before puberty onset can lead to reduced pubertal mammary growth and reduced milk yield potential. 2) Increased growth rate due to high feeding level after puberty and during pregnancy have no effect on mammary growth and milk yield. 3) Higher body weight gain due to higher genetic potential for growth is positively related to milk yield. The negative effect of high feeding level before puberty occurs in all breeds, but the level of feeding causing reduced yield varies. Variation in responses between experiments suggests that feeding regimes that support high growth rates without negative effect on yield can be developed. A breakthrough most likely will originate from increased knowledge of the physiological relationship between nutrition and mammary development. Our investigations suggest that blood growth hormone (GH) is important for mammary development, and that the negative effect of high feeding level on mammary development may be due to reduced blood GH. GH, however, does not bind to mammary tissue. Experiments with exogenous GH suggest that GH acts on mammary tissue via IGF-I, but IGF-I is increased by high feeding level - not decreased as GH. This paradoxical relationship cannot be explained by changes in circulating IGF binding proteins. However, the sensitivity of mammary tissue to IGF-I is reduced by high feeding level, probably due to the action of locally produced binding proteins and/or growth factors. © 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.","author":[{"family":"Sejrsen","given":"K."},{"family":"Purup","given":"S."},{"family":"Vestergaard","given":"M."},{"family":"Foldager","given":"J."}],"citation-key":"Sejrsen2000","container-title":"Domestic Animal Endocrinology","DOI":"10.1016/S0739-7240(00)00070-9","ISSN":"07397240","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]},"page":"93-104","PMID":"11025189","title":"High body weight gain and reduced bovine mammary growth: Physiological basis and implications for milk yield potential","type":"article-journal","volume":"19"},

The growth of fungi was inhibited most strongly by the FPA+i preparation (containing a mixture of formic and propionic acids and ammonium ions). The yeast cell counts dropped (P<<0.05) from 8.50 107 CFU g(-1) silage in the control (CCS = control corn silage) to 2.60 107 CFU g(-1) in silage treated with FPA+i, whereas counts of the mould fungi cells - from 15.20 104 CFU g(-1) silage in the control to 4.60 104 CFU g(-1) in silage treated with FPA+i. The applied conservants increased (P<<0.05) the content of DM from 255.00 g kg(-1) in control to 266.60 g kg(-1) with PA, WSC from 27.10 g kg(-1) DM to 30.50 g kg(-1) DM with FPA+i and ethanol from 9.10 g kg(-1) DM to 11.21 g kg(-1) DM with FPA+i in the silage. The additives decreased concentrations of lactic acid, acetic acid and crude protein concentration after opening the barrels. The diversifying factors decreased the pH value in the examined silage. The experimental conservants were found to improve the aerobic stability of silages after 7 days of air exposure.","author":[{"family":"Selwet","given":"M"}],"citation-key":"Selwet2008","container-title":"Polish journal of veterinary sciences","ISSN":"15051773","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"page":"119-123","PMID":"18683540","title":"Effect of organic acids on numbers of yeasts and mould fungi and aerobic stability in the silage of corn.","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"SeyedAlmoosavi2021","abstract":"The objective of this study was to differentiate the effects of acute heat stress (HS) from those of decreased dry matter intake (DMI) during the prepartum period on metabolism, colostrum, and subsequent production of dairy cows. Holstein dairy cows (n = 30) with similar parity and body weight were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments on 45 d before calving: (1) cooled (CL, n = 10) conditions with ad libitum feed intake, (2) HS conditions with ad libitum feed intake (n = 10), and (3) pair-fed cooled (CLPF, n = 10) with reduced DMI similar to the HS group while housed under cooled conditions. The reduction in the amount of feed offered to the CLPF cows was calculated daily as the percentage decrease from the average DMI of HS cows relative to the CL cows. For CLPF and CL cows, barns provided shade, sprinklers, and fans, whereas the HS cows were provided only with shade. Cows in all groups received individually the same total mixed ration. Cows were dried off 60 d before the expected calving. Cows in the HS group and, by design, the CLPF cows had reduced DMI (~20%) during the experiment. Heat stress decreased gestation length, first colostrum yield, and calf birth weight compared with CL and CLPF cows. Milk yield decreased 21% (5 kg) in the HS and 8% (2 kg) in CLPF cows, indicating that reduced feed intake during late gestation accounted for 60% of the total reduced milk yield. The CLPF cows exhibited an elevated NEFA concentration compared with the CL and HS cows. The HS cows had a greater mRNA abundance of HSP70 in the peripheral blood leukocytes at 21 d prepartum compared with the other groups. At calving, the mRNA abundance of HSP70 was greater in HS cows, followed by CLPF, compared with the CL cows. In conclusion, HS during the late gestation period caused metabolism and production differences, which were only partially attributed to reduced feed intake in dairy cows.","author":[{"family":"Seyed Almoosavi","given":"S.

  {"id":"Sharma1981","abstract":"Sixty young Holstein calves were fed five diets containing various amounts of rye grain up to 18 wk of age. Average daily gain and feed consumption were similar during the first 6 wk; however, calves receiving 60% rye consumed less feed and gained slower than the barley control and 80% roasted rye fed groups in the next 12 wk. Ratios of feed to gain were not different among the five treatments. Apparent digestibilities of the calf diets measured at 10 wk of age were not different; however, calves fed 60 and 80% rye diets tended to show lower digestibilities than the barley control group. Roasting of rye improved digestibilities of acid-detergent fiber and ether extract but slightly reduced protein digestion. Twelve lactating Holstein cows were fed four diets containing 0, 25, 50, and 75% rolled rye in the grain mixtures and grass silage in a switch back design. Grass silage and grain mixtures were offered separately in a 40:60 ratio (dry matter) twice daily but free choice. Replacement of barley with rye in the grain mixtures reduced the total dry matter intake by lactating cows with little effect on average daily milk production, milk composition, and milk prolactin.","author":[{"family":"Sharma","given":"H.R."},{"family":"Ingalls","given":"J.R."},{"family":"McKirdy","given":"J.a."},{"family":"Sanford","given":"L.M."}],"citation-key":"Sharma1981","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(81)82591-X","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1981"]]},"page":"441-448","title":"Evaluation of Rye Grain in the Diets of Young Holstein Calves and Lactating Dairy Cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002203028182591X","volume":"64"},

  {"id":"Sheldon2015","abstract":"OPTIMISING dairy herd fertility and productivity depends on maximising the pregnancy rate (the proportion of inseminations resulting in a pregnancy). However, pregnancy rates in dairy cattle are at an all-time low in many countries, so the study by Bijker and others (2015), summarised on p 411 of this issue of Veterinary Record, makes interesting reading. The study looks at factors that influenced pregnancy rate in a 500-cow dairy herd. Using accelerometers to monitor cow activity, the authors found that insemination was most successful 11 and a half hours after the onset of increased activity. These data are reassuring, as they support the widely used AM:PM rule for insemination, where animals observed in oestrus during the morning are inseminated in the afternoon or evening, and vice versa. However, the most striking finding from the study was that an elevated milk somatic cell count (SCC) was the only significant factor in the final statistical model that affected pregnancy rate. Specifically, pregnancy rate was reduced by 10 per cent if milk SCC measured between 0 and four weeks before insemination exceeded 20,000 cells/ml. As individual cow milk SCC is measured monthly in many dairy herds to monitor subclinical mastitis, these data are readily available to farmers and veterinarians.

  {"id":"Shibata2009","abstract":"In genetic mapping of complex traits, scored haplotypes are likely to represent only a subset of all causal polymorphisms. At the extreme of this scenario, observed polymorphisms are not themselves functional, and only linked to causal ones via linkage disequilibrium (LD). We will demonstrate that due to such incomplete knowledge regarding the underlying genetic mechanism, the variance of a trait may become different between the scored haplotypes. Thus, unequal variances between haplotypes may be indicative of additional functional polymorphisms affecting the trait. Methods accounting for such haplotype-specific variance may also provide an increased power to detect complex associations. We suggest ways to estimate and test these haplotypic variance contrasts, and incorporate them into the haplotypic tests for association. We further extend this approach to data with unknown gametic phase via likelihood-based simultaneous estimation of haplotypic effects and their frequencies. We find our approach to provide additional power, especially under the following types of models: (a) where scored and unobserved variants are epistatically interacting with each other; and (b) under heterogeneity models, where multiple unobserved mutations are linked to non-functional observed polymorphisms via LD. An illustrative example of usefulness of the method is discussed, utilizing analysis of multilocus effects within the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Shibata","given":"Kyoko"},{"family":"Diatchenko","given":"Luda"},{"family":"Zaykin","given":"Dmitri V"}],"citation-key":"Shibata2009","container-title":"Genetic epidemiology","DOI":"10.1002/gepi.20358","ISSN":"0741-0395","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",1]]},"page":"63-78","PMID":"18636529","title":"Haplotype associations with quantitative traits in the presence of complex multilocus and heterogeneous effects.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2700858&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","volume":"33"},

  {"id":"shine2022","abstract":"Machine learning applications are becoming more ubiquitous in dairy farming decision support applications in areas such as feeding, animal husbandry, healthcare, animal behavior, milking and resource management. Thus, the objective of this mapping study was to collate and assess studies published in journals and conference proceedings between 1999 and 2021, which applied machine learning algorithms to dairy farming-related problems to identify trends in the geographical origins of data, as well as the algorithms, features and evaluation metrics and methods used. This mapping study was carried out in line with PRISMA guidelines, with six pre-defined research questions (RQ) and a broad and unbiased search strategy that explored five databases. In total, 129 publications passed the pre-defined selection criteria, from which relevant data required to answer each RQ were extracted and analyzed. This study found that Europe (43% of studies) produced the largest number of publications (RQ1), while the largest number of articles were published in the Computers and Electronics in Agriculture journal (21%) (RQ2). The largest number of studies addressed problems related to the physiology and health of dairy cows (32%) (RQ3), while the most frequently employed feature data were derived from sensors (48%) (RQ4). The largest number of studies employed tree-based algorithms (54%) (RQ5), while RMSE (56%) (regression) and accuracy (77%) (classification) were the most frequently employed metrics used, and hold-out cross-validation (39%) was the most frequently employed evaluation method (RQ6). Since 2018, there has been more than a sevenfold increase in the number of studies that focused on the physiology and health of dairy cows, compared to almost a threefold increase in the overall number of publications, suggesting an increased focus on this subdomain. In addition, a fivefold increase in the number of publications that employed neural network algorithms was identified since 2018, in comparison to a threefold increase in the use of both tree-based algorithms and statistical regression algorithms, suggesting an increasing utilization of neural network-based algorithms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Shine","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Murphy","given":"Michael D."}],"citation-key":"shine2022","container-title":"Sensors","DOI":"10.3390/s22010052","ISSN":"1424-8220","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"1","page":"52","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Over 20 Years of Machine Learning Applications on Dairy Farms: A Comprehensive Mapping Study","title-short":"Over 20 Years of Machine Learning Applications on Dairy Farms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/1/52","volume":"22"},

Intraduodenal infusion of oleic acid emulsion in a dose of 18 mmollh resulted in a significant increase in pancreatic secretion of water, bicarbonate, and protein, which was accompanied by increased plasma concentrations of both secretin and cholecystokinin. Infusion of pancreatic juice or bovine trypsin into the duodenum significantly inhibited the oleic acid-stimulated pancreatic secretion. This inhibition coincided with a significant decrease in plasma secretin level, whereas plasma cholecystokinin concentration was not affected by either pancreatic juice or trypsin. Neither pancreatic secretion nor plasma secretin concentration was affected by intraduodenal administration of NaHCO3 solution. The trypsin-induced suppression of pancreatic secretion was prevented by intravenous administration of secretin in a dose that achieved a plasma secretin level comparable to that during the oleic acid administration.

Treatments were 42 or 35% NFC and 0 or 3 g of AO per day arranged as a 2 x 2 factorial. Diets formulated to contain 21% NDF from alfalfa silage (48.4% of ration DM) and 18.5% CP were fed as total mixed rations twice daily. Alteration of dietary NFC level was by partial replacement of shelled corn and soybean meal with wheat middlings and brewers dried grains. Intake of NDF was higher (1.49 vs 1.22% of BW) for 35 than for 42% NFC diets, but DMI was lower (24.1 vs 24.9 kg/d). Milkfat percentage, ruminal pH, ammonia, acetate (moles/100 moles), and total tract digestibility of fiber were higher for 35% NFC diets; however, ruminal disappearance of DM, CP, and NDF from Dacron bags containing alfalfa hay was not affected (P > .10) by NFC level. Supplementation with AO did not affect (P > .10) DMI, milk yield, or nutrient digestion. Partial replacement of corn with high-fiber byproducts to lower dietary NFC level and correspondingly increase NDF level increased NDF intake but effected only a small change in DMI. Reducing dietary NFC level improved ruminal fermentation and milkfat percentage without significantly affecting milk yield.","author":[{"family":"Sievert","given":"S J"},{"family":"Shaver","given":"R D"}],"citation-key":"Sievert1993","container-title":"Journal of animal science","ISSN":"0021-8812","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993",4]]},"page":"1032-40","PMID":"8386716","title":"Effect of nonfiber carbohydrate level and Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract on intake, digestion, and milk production in lactating dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8386716","volume":"71"},

  {"id":"Sinclair2013","abstract":"The effect of inorganic (INORG) or organic (ORG) Cu, fed without (-) or with (+) additional S and Mo on Cu status and performance was examined using 56 early lactation dairy cows in a 2 × 2 factorial study design. Supplementary Cu was added as either CuSO4 or Bioplex Cu (Alltech Inc., Nicholasville, Kentucky) to provide an additional 10 mg of Cu/kg of dry matter (DM), with S added at 1.5 g/kg of DM and Mo at 6.8 mg/kg of DM to reduce Cu bioavailability. The basal ration was composed of corn and grass silages (2:1 respectively, DM basis) and straight feeds. Cows commenced the study at wk 7 of lactation and remained on treatment for 16 wk. An interaction existed between Cu source and added S and Mo on DM intake, with cows offered INORG- Cu having an increased intake compared with those offered INORG+ or ORG- Cu. Milk yield averaged 35.4 kg/d, and was 5% higher with milk fat content 6% lower in cows fed INORG compared with ORG Cu, but milk fat yield, energy-corrected milk yield, and milk protein content did not differ between treatments. A trend existed for cows to have a higher body weight gain when offered ORG compared with INORG Cu. Cows fed diets containing INORG Cu had a higher milk concentration of C17:0 and C18:3n-3 compared with those fed diets containing ORG Cu. Cows fed added S and Mo had a lower milk concentration of C17:0 and C18:0 compared with those that were not supplemented. No effect was observed of dietary treatment on plasma Cu concentration, which averaged 13.1 μmol/L, except during wk 12 when cows receiving added S and Mo had a lower concentration. No effect was observed of Cu source on mean plasma Mo concentrations, but during wk 16 cows offered INORG Cu had a higher concentration than those offered ORG Cu. Hepatic Cu levels decreased by approximately 0.9 mg/kg of DM per day when fed additional S and Mo, but no effect of Cu source was observed. A trend existed for hepatic ATPase, Cu++ transporting, beta polypeptide (ATP7B) to be upregulated in cows when fed S and Mo along with ORG but not INORG Cu. In conclusion, the inclusion of an ORG compared with an INORG source of Cu reduced milk yield but increased milk fat concentration and body weight gain, with no effect on energy-corrected milk yield. Little effect was observed of dietary Cu supply on plasma mineral concentration, liver mRNA abundance, or milk fatty acid profile, whereas the addition of S and Mo reduced hepatic Cu concentrations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",5,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Sinclair","given":"L","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Hart","given":"K J"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"D"},{"family":"Mackenzie","given":"a M"}],"citation-key":"Sinclair2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-6322","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",5,6]]},"page":"4355-4367","PMID":"23660145","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of inorganic or organic copper fed without or with added sulfur and molybdenum on the performance, indicators of copper status, and hepatic mRNA in dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23660145","volume":"96"},

Due to the general awareness of its importance for the overall well-being, vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is now recognized as a major health issue.

The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a member of the steroid hormone receptors that induces a cascade of cell signaling to maintain healthy Ca2+ levels that serve to regulate several biological functions. However, the roles of vitamin D and its metabolism in maintaining gastric homeostasis have not yet been completely elucidated. Currently, there is a need to increase the vitamin D status in individuals worldwide as it has been shown to improve musculoskeletal health and reduce the risk of chronic illnesses, including some cancers, autoimmune and infectious diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, neurocognitive disorders, and general mortality.

  {"id":"Slavik2008","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Selenium (Se) is important for the postnatal development of the calf. In the first weeks of life, milk is the only source of Se for the calf and insufficient level of Se in the milk may lead to Se deficiency. Maternal Se supplementation is used to prevent this.We investigated the effect of dietary Se-enriched yeast (SY) or sodium selenite (SS) supplements on selected blood parameters and on Se concentrations in the blood, colostrum, and milk of Se-deficient Charolais cows. METHODS: Cows in late pregnancy received a mineral premix with Se (SS or SY, 50 mg Se per kg premix) or without Se (control--C). Supplementation was initiated 6 weeks before expected calving. Blood and colostrum samples were taken from the cows that had just calved (Colostral period). Additional samples were taken around 2 weeks (milk) and 5 weeks (milk and blood) after calving corresponding to Se supplementation for 6 and 12 weeks, respectively (Lactation period) for Se, biochemical and haematological analyses. RESULTS: Colostral period. Se concentrations in whole blood and colostrum on day 1 post partum and in colostrum on day 3 post partum were 93.0, 72.9, and 47.5 microg/L in the SY group; 68.0, 56.0 and 18.8 microg/L in the SS group; and 35.1, 27.3 and 10.5 microg/L in the C group, respectively. Differences among all the groups were significant (P < 0.01) at each sampling, just as the colostrum Se content decreases were from day 1 to day 3 in each group. The relatively smallest decrease in colostrum Se concentration was found in the SY group (P < 0.01).Lactation period. The mean Se concentrations in milk in weeks 6 and 12 of supplementation were 20.4 and 19.6 microg/L in the SY group, 8.3 and 11.9 microgg/L in the SS group, and 6.9 and 6.6 microgg/L in the C group, respectively. The values only differed significantly in the SS group (P < 0.05). The Se concentrations in the blood were similar to those of cows examined on the day of calving. The levels of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity were 364.70, 283.82 and 187.46 microgkat/L in the SY, SS, and C groups, respectively. This was the only significantly variable biochemical and haematological parameter. CONCLUSION: Se-enriched yeast was much more effective than sodium selenite in increasing the concentration of Se in the blood, colostrum and milk, as well as the GSH-Px activity.","author":[{"family":"Slavik","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Illek","given":"Josef"},{"family":"Brix","given":"Michal"},{"family":"Hlavicova","given":"Jaroslava"},{"family":"Rajmon","given":"Radko"},{"family":"Jilek","given":"Frantisek"}],"citation-key":"Slavik2008","container-title":"Acta veterinaria Scandinavica","DOI":"10.1186/1751-0147-50-43","ISSN":"1751-0147","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"page":"43","PMID":"18980689","title":"Influence of organic versus inorganic dietary selenium supplementation on the concentration of selenium in colostrum, milk and blood of beef cows.","type":"article-journal","volume":"50"},
  {"id":"smidDairyCowPreference2018","abstract":"Dairy cows display a partial preference for being outside, but little is known about what aspects of the outdoor environment are important to cows. The primary aim of this study was to test the preference of lactating dairy cattle for pasture versus an outdoor sand pack during the night. A secondary aim was to determine whether feeding and perching behavior changed when cows were provided outdoor access. A third objective was to investigate how the lying behavior of cows changed when given access to different outdoor areas. Ninety-six lactating pregnant cows were assigned to 8 groups of 12 animals each. After a baseline phase of 2 d in which cows were kept inside the freestall barn, cows were habituated to the outdoor areas by providing them access to each of the 2 options for 24 h. Cows were then given access, in random order by group, to either the pasture (pasture phase) or the sand pack (sand phase). As we tested the 2 outdoor options using space allowances consistent with what would be practical on commercial dairy farms, the space provided on pasture was larger (21,000 m2) than that provided on the sand pack (144 m2). Cows were tested at night (for 2 nights in each condition), from 2000 h until morning milking at approximately 0800 h, as preference to be outdoors is strongest at this time. During the next 3 nights cows were given access to both outside options simultaneously (choice phase). Feeding and perching behaviors were recorded when cows were indoors during the day and night periods. Lying behavior was automatically recorded by HOBO data loggers (Onset, Bourne, MA). Cows spent more time outside in the pasture phase (90.0 ± 5.9%) compared with the sand phase (44.4 ± 6.3%). When provided simultaneous access to both options, cows spent more time on pasture than on the sand pack (90.5 ± 2.6% vs. 0.8 ± 0.5%, respectively). Time spent feeding indoors during the day did not change regardless of what type of outdoor access was provided, but there was a decline in perching during the day when cows were provided access to either outdoor option at night. Lying time in the pasture phase was lower than in the baseline or sand phase. During the nighttime, lying time outside was not different between the sand (55.4 ± 7.9%) and pasture (52.0 ± 7.4%) phases. In summary, cows spent a considerable amount of time outside during the night when given the opportunity and showed a preference for a large pasture versus a small sand pack as an outdoor area.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Smid","given":"Anne-Marieke C."},{"family":"Weary","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Costa","given":"Joao H.C."},{"family":"Keyserlingk","given":"Marina A.G.","non-dropping-particle":"von"}],"citation-key":"smidDairyCowPreference2018","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/JDS.2017-13294","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,1]]},"page":"1448-1455","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Dairy cow preference for different types of outdoor access","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030217311153#.WmUMxbw5HJA.linkedin","volume":"101"},

  {"id":"Solano2017","abstract":"A high prevalence of digital dermatitis (DD) and the benefits of early topical treatment highlight the need for simple tools for routine DD detection. The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of scoring DD lesions using the 5 M-stage scoring system in the milking parlor compared with the trimming chute as the gold standard. Three observers inspected 3,585 cows and 6,991 hind feet from 9 farms in the milking parlor using a mirror (glued to a plastic kitchen spatula) and a headlamp, followed by inspection in a trimming chute within 5 d. Interobserver agreement for scoring DD in various settings was ≥82% (kappa >0.74; weighted kappa >0.76). At trimming chute inspections, 68% of cows had at least 1 DD lesion, 19% had 1 hind leg affected, and 49% had both hind legs affected. Within-herd DD prevalence ranged from 16 to 81% of cows affected. True within-herd prevalence was 2, 6, 0, 36, and 14% for M1, M2, M3, M4, and M4.1 lesions, respectively. At the foot level, DD prevalence was the same (58%) in the milking parlor and trimming chute inspection, but distribution of M-stages differed. Milking parlor inspection as a means of identifying the presence of DD lesions had a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 88%, with positive and negative predictive values of 91 and 89%, respectively. Agreement between milking parlor and trimming chute inspections was 73% (kappa = 0.59, weighted kappa = 0.65) for the 5 M-stage scoring system and 90% (kappa = 0.80) if only the presence of a lesion was noted. Test characteristics varied greatly among M-stages, with the highest sensitivity for detecting M4 (82%) and M2 (62%) lesions, and the lowest for detecting M4.1 (20%), M1 (7%), and M3 (0%) lesions. In the milking parlor, 20% of M2 lesions were misclassified as M4.1, 8% of M4 lesions were misclassified as M0, and 68% of M4.1 lesions were misclassified as M4. The majority (87%) of DD lesions were located between the heel bulbs; 10 and 2% of DD lesions affected the interdigital space and the front of the foot, respectively. The sensitivity to detect the presence of a lesion when it occurred between the heel bulbs was 93%, but <67% if it occurred elsewhere on the foot. We concluded that inspection of the rear feet in the milking parlor was an inexpensive and simple method of detecting and scoring DD lesions. If the objective is to determine herd-level DD prevalence and routine monitoring, this method was adequately reliable. However, if the objective is to follow up DD in cows with history of interdigital hyperplasia or to detect M1 or M4.1 lesions, this method was not sufficiently reliable. Although DD scoring in the milking parlor as a routine practice should facilitate early detection, prompt treatment interventions, and herd monitoring, it was not sufficiently reliable to replace definitive identification of M-stages in the trimming chute.","author":[{"family":"Solano","given":"L."},{"family":"Barkema","given":"H.W."},{"family":"Jacobs","given":"C."},{"family":"Orsel","given":"K."}],"citation-key":"Solano2017","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2016-11365","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"1592-1603","PMID":"27889123","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Validation of the M-stage scoring system for digital dermatitis on dairy cows in the milking parlor","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030216308219","volume":"100"},

Data on the chemical composition of spelt and its variations, especially their nutritional value for ruminants, are scarce. Therefore, hulled kernels, dehulled kernels and hulls of six spelt cultivars grown on three different locations were analysed for their chemical composition and nutritive value for ruminants using the Hohenheim Gas Test. Most of the analysed constituents varied considerably and were significantly affected by the cultivars or location, or both. Hulled spelt and spelt kernels of more recent cultivars had higher starch and energy concentrations and lower concentrations of crude protein and fibre fractions than those of traditional cultivars. Significant differences between cultivars were found in the energy values for ruminants for hulled spelt but not for fractionated kernels. Spelt hulls of different cultivars and locations showed a high variation in chemical composition with overall high concentrations of fibre fractions and crude ash. The nutritive values for ruminants of hulled spelt and spelt kernels were similar to those of oats and wheat respectively. Pure spelt hulls cannot be recommended for use in ruminant feeding because of their high concentrations of fibre fractions and crude ash. However, when some part of the kernel (~20%) or small kernels remain with the hull in the dehulling process, the resulting hull fraction has a metabolizable energy value for ruminants that is similar to that of wheat straw.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Sommerfeld","given":"Vera"},{"family":"Steingaß","given":"Herbert"},{"family":"Longin","given":"C.

Fatty acid (FA) treatments were: 1) Control (CON; no supplemental fat); 2) C16:0 supplement (PA; ~80% C16:0); 3) C16:0 and C18:0 supplement (PA+SA; ~40% C16:0 + ~40% C18:0); and 4) C16:0 and cis -9 C18:1 supplement (PA+OA; ~45% C16:0 + ~35% cis -  C  : )  The final   d of each period were used for sample and data collection. The statistical model included the random effect of cow and the fixed effects of basal diet, FA treatment, period, and their interactions. Compared with SH diets, CS diets increased milk fat yield (1.71 vs. 1.51 kg/d; P = 0.05), yield of preformed milk FA (623 vs. 507 g/d; P < 0.01), and BW gain (1.0 vs. 0.71 kg/d; P = 0.04), tended to increase yield of de novo milk FA (396 vs. 383 g/d; P = 0.06), but re - duced NDF digestibility (41.9 vs. 46.4%; P < 0.01) and total FA digestibility (74.2 vs. 76.3% P = 0.05). Compared with other treatments, PA increased yield of milk fat (1.60, 1.70, 1.64 and 1.64 kg/d; P < 0.05) and 3.5% FCM (45.2, 47.8, 46.8 and 46.5 kg/d; P < 0.01) for CON, PA, PA+SA and PA+OA, respectively. PA+OA increased BW gain compared with other treatments (0.82, 0.84, 0.70 and 1.05 kg/d; P < 0.05) for CON, PA, PA+SA and PA+OA, respectively. PA and PA+OA tended to increase NDF digestibility compared with PA+SA and CON (43.2, 44.9, 43.1 and 44.5%; P < 0.10) for CON, PA, PA+SA and PA+OA, respectively. Compared with the other treatments, PA+SA reduced 16-carbon (77.6, 73.0, 66.0 and 79.1%; P < 0.01), 18-carbon (79.2, 79.5, 72.0 and 79.7%%; P < 0.01), and total FA digestibility (78.6, 77.4, 68.2 and 79.4%; P < 0.01) for CON, PA, PA+SA and PA+OA, respectively. In conclusion, diet inclusion of C16:0 increased energy out - put in milk, while inclusion cis -9 C18:1 increased BW gain. The combination of C16:0 and C18:0 reduced NDF and FA digestibilities, which likely explains its reduced performance compared with other treatments","author":[{"family":"Souza","given":"J.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Preseault","given":"C.L."},{"family":"Lock","given":"A.L."}],"citation-key":"Souza2016a","container-title":"ADSA 2016 Abstracts","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"620","publisher":"ADSA","title":"Altering the ratio of palmitic, stearic and oleic acids in diets with or without whole cottonseed impacts production responses and energy partitioning of dairy cows.","type":"paper-conference"},

The objective of the current study was to conduct a meta-regression to characterize the variation in rumination time and its relationship with milk and milk fat yields and variables mechanistically associated with milk fat synthesis, including rumen pH and total-tract digestibility. The analysis included 130 journal articles published between 1986 and 2018 that reported 479 treatment means from lactating Holsteins cows during established lactation. Milk yield averaged 34.3 kg/d (range 14.2–52.1 kg/d), milk fat averaged 3.47% (range 2.20–4.60%), and rumen pH averaged 6.1 (range 5.3–7.0). Rumination observation systems were categorized into 6 groups, but there was little difference in average rumination time among systems. The total time spent ruminating averaged 444 min/d (range 151–638 d) and occurred in 13.8 bouts/d (range 7.8–17.4 bouts/d) that averaged 32.7 min (range 20.0–48.1 min). Bivariate regressions were modeled to include the random effect of study, and correlations were evaluated through the partial R<sup>2</sup> that excluded variation accounted for by the random effect. Rumination time was quadratically increased with increasing milk fat yield (partial R<sup>2</sup> = 0.27) and milk fat percent (partial R<sup>2</sup> = 0.17). Rumination was also increased with increasing milk yield, dry matter intake, and rumen pH, and was quadratically related to dietary neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and total-tract NDF digestibility (partial R<sup>2</sup> = 0.10–0.27). Similar relationships were observed for rumination per unit of dry matter and NDF intake. The best-fit multivariate model predicting total rumination time included milk yield, milk fat yield, and concentration and accounted for 37% of the variation. Total-tract digestibility was available for 217 treatment means; when included in the model, the partial R<sup>2</sup> increased to 0.41. Last, principal component analysis was conducted to explore the relationship among variables. The first 2 principal components in the broad analyses explained 36.7% of the 39 variables evaluated, which included rumination bouts and time spent ruminating. In conclusion, rumination time was related to milk fat across a large number of studies, although it explained only a limited amount of the variation in milk fat.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Souza","given":"Jocely G."},{"family":"Ribeiro","given":"Claudio V.D.M."},{"family":"Harvatine","given":"Kevin J."}],"citation-key":"souzaMetaanalysisRuminationBehavior2022","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/JDS.2021-20535","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,1]]},"page":"188-200","PMID":"34635357","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Meta-analysis of rumination behavior and its relationship with milk and milk fat production, rumen pH, and total-tract digestibility in lactating dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030221009309/fulltext","volume":"105"},

  {"id":"spears2022","abstract":"Purpose\nThe purpose of this article is to review criteria for assessing copper, zinc, manganese, and selenium status in ruminants. Factors that affect measurements of trace mineral status also will be discussed.\nSources\nPublished scientific literature was the primary source of information reviewed.\nSynthesis\nWhen assessing mineral status, it is always good to analyze the diet or forages being consumed for the mineral of interest as well as other minerals that may affect its requirement. Liver is the best indicator of both low and excess Cu status. Plasma Cu concentrations do not decrease below normal values until liver Cu stores are mostly depleted, but a plasma Cu concentration less than 0.4 mg/L suggests Cu deficiency. Severe Zn deficiency can be diagnosed based on extremely low plasma or serum Zn concentrations (less than 0.5 mg/L) or on clinical signs of Zn deficiency that respond to Zn supplementation. It is important to note that infections or acute stress may cause plasma Zn concentrations to temporarily decrease to levels consistent with Zn deficiency. There is currently no reliable indicator of marginal Zn deficiency. Several criteria have been measured in an attempt to assess Mn status. However, no criteria have been demonstrated to accurately predict Mn deprivation. Whole blood or liver Se concentrations are useful in assessing Se status. When interpreting whole blood or liver Se concentrations, it is important to consider whether dietary Se is being derived from organic or inorganic sources.\nConclusions and Applications\nThe most appropriate measurement criteria to assess trace mineral status in ruminants depend on the trace mineral being considered. Liver copper is generally a good measure of low as well as excess Cu status. Liver or whole blood Se concentrations are reliable measures of Se status if one takes into account the source of dietary Se. Unless clinical deficiency signs are apparent, it is more difficult to assess Zn and Mn status. In the absence of disease or stress, plasma or serum Zn concentrations below 0.5 mg/L suggest possible severe deficiency. No reliable predictor of marginal Zn deficiency has been determined. Currently, no reliable indicator of Mn status has been identified.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Spears","given":"J. W."},{"family":"Brandao","given":"V. L.

  {"id":"Speijers2010","abstract":"Three experiments were conducted to test the effectiveness of different footbath solutions and regimens in the treatment of digital dermatitis (DD) in dairy cows. During the study, groups of cows walked through allocated footbath solutions after milking on 4 consecutive occasions. All cows were scored weekly for DD lesion stage on the hind feet during milking. A \"transition grade\" was assigned on the basis of whether the DD lesions improved (1) or deteriorated or did not improve (0) from week to week. This grade per cow was averaged for all cows in the group. In experiment 1, 118 cows were allocated to 1 of 3 footbath treatments for 5 wk: (1) 5% CuSO(4) each week, (2) 2% ClO(-) each week, or (3) no footbath (control). The mean transition grade, and proportion of cows without DD lesions at the end of the trial were significantly higher for treatment 1 above (0.36, 0.13, and 0.11, respectively; standard error of the difference, SED = 0.057). In experiment 2, 117 cows were allocated to 1 of 4 footbath treatment regimens for 8 wk: (1) 5% CuSO(4) each week, (2) 2% CuSO(4) each week, (3) 5% CuSO(4) each fortnight, or (4) 2% CuSO(4) each fortnight. For welfare reasons, cows allocated to the weekly and fortnightly footbath regimens had an average prevalence of >60% and ≤25% active DD at the start of the trial, respectively. Significantly more cows had no DD lesions (0.53 vs. 0.36, respectively; SED = 0.049), and the mean transition grade of DD lesions was higher in the 5% compared with the 2% weekly CuSO(4) treatment (0.52 vs. 0.38, respectively; SED = 0.066). Similarly, significantly more cows had no DD lesions in the 5% compared with the 2% fortnightly CuSO(4) treatments (0.64 vs. 0.47, respectively; SED = 0.049). In experiment 3, 95 cows were allocated to 1 of 3 footbath treatments: (1) each week alternating 5% CuSO(4) with 10% salt water, (2) each week alternating 5% CuSO(4) with water, or (3) 5% CuSO(4) each fortnight (control). After 10 wk, more cows had no DD in the salt water treatment than in the control treatment (0.35 vs. 0.26, respectively; SED = 0.038), but levels of active lesions were higher for this treatment than in the other 2 treatments (0.17, 0.00, and 0.13, respectively; SED = 0.029). Treatment did not affect mean transition grade of DD lesions. In conclusion, CuSO(4) was the only footbath solution that was consistently effective for treatment of DD. In cases when DD prevalence was high, a footbath each week using 5% CuSO(4) was the most effective treatment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Speijers","given":"M H M"},{"family":"Baird","given":"L G"},{"family":"Finney","given":"G","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"McBride","given":"J"},{"family":"Kilpatrick","given":"D J"},{"family":"Logue","given":"D N"},{"family":"O'Connell","given":"N E"}],"citation-key":"Speijers2010","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2010-3468","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",12]]},"page":"5782-91","PMID":"21094750","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effectiveness of different footbath solutions in the treatment of digital dermatitis in dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21094750","volume":"93"},

In the present experiment, it was hypothesized that MUN and the relationship between MUN and UUN or UN is affected by urine volume as a result of dietary sodium chloride intake. Twelve lactating Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (mean ± SD: milk production 28.1±3.23kg/d and 190±41d in milk), of which 4 were fitted with catheters in the urine bladder and jugular vein, were randomly assigned to 4 dietary levels of sodium chloride (3, 9, 14, and 19g of Na/kg of DM) according to a triple 4×4 Latin square design. Cows were fed at 95% of ad libitum intake, excluding salt addition. Milk was analyzed for MUN and protein content; urine was analyzed for total N, urea, and creatinine content; feces were analyzed for total N and DM content; and blood plasma was analyzed for urea and creatinine content. Creatinine clearance rate (CCR; L/min) and renal urea reabsorption ratio were estimated based on plasma concentrations of urea and creatinine, and total excretion of urea and creatinine in urine. Intake of DM and N, milk production, and milk protein content were (mean ± SD), on average, 21.4±1.24kg/d, 522±32.0g/d, 25.4±2.53kg/d, and 3.64±0.186%, respectively. A linear relationship was found between Na intake and urine production [urine (kg/d; mean ± SE)=7.5±4.33+0.136±0.0143 × Na intake (g/d)] and between Na intake and MUN [MUN (mg/dL; mean ± SE)=13.5±0.35-0.0068±0.00104 × Na intake (g/d)]. Despite the decrease in MUN with increased Na intake, UN excretion increased linearly with Na intake. Excretion of UUN was not affected by dietary Na content. A linear plateau relationship was observed between CCR and renal urea reabsorption. An increase in CCR coincided with an increase in calculated renal urea reabsorption until a CCR breakpoint value (mean ± SD) of 1.56±0.063 L/min was reached. We conclude that Na intake is negatively related to MUN, whereas UUN is not affected. Variation in mineral intake levels that affect urine volume should, therefore, be taken into account when using MUN as an indicator of UUN in dairy cattle.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Spek","given":"J W"},{"family":"Bannink","given":"a"},{"family":"Gort","given":"G"},{"family":"Hendriks","given":"W H"},{"family":"Dijkstra","given":"J"}],"citation-key":"Spek2012","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5688","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",12]]},"page":"7288-98","PMID":"23063155","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of sodium chloride intake on urine volume, urinary urea excretion, and milk urea concentration in lactating dairy cattle.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23063155","volume":"95"},
  {"id":"Spek2013","abstract":"A meta-analysis was conducted on the effect of dietary and animal factors on the excretion of total urinary nitrogen (UN) and urinary urea nitrogen (UUN) in lactating dairy cattle in North America (NA) and northwestern Europe (EU). Mean treatment data were used from 47 trials carried out in NA and EU. Mixed model analysis was used with experiment included as a random effect and all other factors, consisting of dietary and animal characteristics, included as fixed effects. Fixed factors were nested within continent (EU or NA). A distinction was made between urinary excretions based on either urine spot samples or calculated assuming a zero N balance, and excretions that were determined by total collection of urine only. Moreover, with the subset of data based on total collection of urine, a new data set was created by calculating urinary N excretion assuming a zero N balance. Comparison with the original subset of data allowed for examining the effect of such an assumption on the relationship established between milk urea N (MUN) concentration and UN. Of all single dietary and animal factors evaluated to predict N excretion in urine, MUN and dietary crude protein (CP) concentration were by far the best predictors. Urinary N excretion was best predicted by the combination of MUN, CP, and dry matter intake, whereas UUN was best predicted by the combination of MUN and CP. All other factors did not improve or only marginally improved the prediction of UN or UUN. The relationship between UN and MUN differed between NA and EU, with higher estimated regression coefficients for MUN for the NA data set. Precision of UN and UUN prediction improved substantially when only UN or UUN data based on total collection of urine were used. The relationship between UN and MUN for the NA data set, but not for the EU data set, was substantially altered when UN was calculated assuming a zero N balance instead of being based on the total collection of urine. According to results of the present meta-analysis, UN and UUN are best predicted by the combination of MUN and CP and that, in regard to precision and accuracy, prediction equations for UN and UUN should be derived from the total collection of urine. © 2013 American Dairy Science Association.","author":[{"family":"Spek","given":"J.

If a locus is subject to genomic imprinting, however, this assumption does not hold. We incorporate imprinting into the standard quantitative-genetic model for two alleles at a single locus, deriving expressions for the additive and dominance components of genetic variance, as well as measures of resemblance among relatives. We show that, in contrast to the case with Mendelian expression, the additive and dominance deviations are correlated. In principle, this correlation allows imprinting to be detected solely on the basis of different measures of familial resemblances, but in practice, the standard error of the estimate is likely to be too large for a test to have much statistical power. The effects of genomic imprinting will need to be incorporated into quantitative-genetic models of many traits, for example, those concerned with mammalian birthweight.","author":[{"family":"Spencer","given":"Hamish G"}],"citation-key":"spencer2002","container-title":"Genetics","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"page":"411-417","title":"The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Genomic Imprinting","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/abstract/161/1/411","volume":"161"},

  {"id":"Spurlock2012","abstract":"Objectives of the current study were to estimate genetic parameters in Holstein cows for energy balance (EB) and related traits including dry matter intake (DMI), body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS), energy-corrected milk (ECM) production, and gross feed efficiency (GFE), defined as the ratio of total ECM yield to total DMI over the first 150 d of lactation. Data were recorded for the first half of lactation on 227 and 175 cows in their first or later lactation, respectively. Random regression models were fitted to longitudinal data. Also, each trait was averaged over monthly intervals and analyzed by single and multivariate animal models. Heritability estimates ranged from 0.27 to 0.63, 0.12 to 0.62, 0.12 to 0.49, 0.63 to 0.72, and 0.49 to 0.53 for DMI, ECM yield, EB, BW, and BCS, respectively, averaged over monthly intervals. Daily heritability estimates ranged from 0.18 to 0.30, 0.10 to 0.26, 0.07 to 0.22, 0.43 to 0.67, and 0.25 to 0.38 for DMI, ECM yield, EB, BW, and BCS, respectively. Estimated heritability for GFE was 0.32. The genetic correlation of EB at 10d in milk (DIM) with EB at 150 DIM was -0.19, suggesting the genetic regulation of this trait differs by stage of lactation. Positive genetic correlations were found among DMI, ECM yield, and BW averaged over monthly intervals, whereas correlations of these traits with BCS depended upon stage of lactation. Total ECM yield for the lactation was positively correlated with DMI, but a negative genetic correlation between total ECM yield and EB was found. However, the genetic correlation between total ECM yield and EB in the first month of lactation was -0.02, indicating that total production is not genetically correlated with EB during the first month of lactation, when negative EB is most closely associated with diminished fitness. The genetic correlation between GFE and EB ranged from -0.73 to -0.99, indicating that selection for more efficient cows would favor a lower energy status. However, the genetic correlation between EB in the first month of lactation and GFE calculated from 75 to 150 DIM was not significant, indicating that the unfavorable correlation between GFE and EB in early lactation may be minimized with alternative definitions of efficiency. Thus, EB, GFE and related traits will likely respond to genetic selection in Holstein cows. However, the impact of selection for improved feed efficiency on EB must be carefully considered to avoid potential negative consequences of further reductions in EB at the onset of lactation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Spurlock","given":"D M"},{"family":"Dekkers","given":"J C M"},{"family":"Fernando","given":"R"},{"family":"Koltes","given":"D","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Wolc","given":"a"}],"citation-key":"Spurlock2012","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-5407","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",9]]},"page":"5393-402","PMID":"22916946","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Genetic parameters for energy balance, feed efficiency, and related traits in Holstein cattle.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22916946","volume":"95"},

Forty Holstein heifers [mean age 84.2 ± 1.2 d; body weight (BW) 99.8 ± 10.8 kg (mean ± SD)] were housed in a freestall barn, blocked by birth date, and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments in a randomized complete block design. Treatments were (1) 100 g of soybean meal carrier (control; CON); (2) 0.75 g of SB/kg of BW + carrier (SB); (3) 1 mg of MON/kg of BW + carrier (MON); (4) 1 mg of MON/kg of BW + 0.75 g of SB/kg of BW (MSB). Data were analyzed using single degree of freedom contrasts evaluating CON versus additives (ADD), SB versus MON, and SB and MON versus MSB. Treatments were hand-mixed daily. Feed and orts were measured daily and frozen at −20°C. Orts samples were subsampled for dry matter (DM) determination, and total mixed ration samples were taken weekly and composited monthly for DM and nutrient analysis. Initial BW, heart and paunch girths, body length, blood samples, and fecal coccidia counts were measured before the start and weekly during the 12-wk trial. Blood samples were analyzed for glucose, plasma urea nitrogen (PUN), and ketone concentrations. Apparent total-tract nutrient digestibility was determined from d 21 to 27 and from d 63 to 69 using acid detergent insoluble ash as a marker. Daily dry matter intake (DMI) and metabolizable energy intake were increased in ADD compared with CON, and average BW, final BW, and heart girth tended to increase. Whereas MSB tended to be greater than SB and MON for heart girth, feed efficiency was greater with MON compared with SB. Compared with CON, ADD decreased coccidia counts. No effect of treatment on PUN was detected. Monensin and SB tended to have greater plasma glucose than MSB did. Average blood ketone concentrations were greater with ADD versus CON, in SB versus MON, and in MSB versus SB and MON. During the wk-3 digestibility phase, DMI tended to be greater in heifers fed SB versus MON, as well as in heifers fed MSB versus SB and MON. Digestibility of nutrients were similar, except that starch digestibility was increased in heifers fed MSB versus SB and MON. During the wk-9 digestibility phase, DMI and digestibility of nutrients were similar, except NDF, which tended to be greater in CON than in ADD.

  {"id":"stanley2018","abstract":"Beef cattle have been identified as the largest livestock-sector contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Using life cycle analysis (LCA), several studies have concluded that grass-finished beef systems have greater GHG intensities than feedlot-finished (FL) beef systems. These studies evaluated only one grazing management system – continuous grazing – and assumed steady-state soil carbon (C), to model the grass-finishing environmental impact. However, by managing for more optimal forage growth and recovery, adaptive multi-paddock (AMP) grazing can improve animal and forage productivity, potentially sequestering more soil organic carbon (SOC) than continuous grazing. To examine impacts of AMP grazing and related SOC sequestration on net GHG emissions, a comparative LCA was performed of two different beef finishing systems in the Upper Midwest, USA: AMP grazing and FL. We used on-farm data collected from the Michigan State University Lake City AgBioResearch Center for AMP grazing. Impact scope included GHG emissions from enteric methane, feed production and mineral supplement manufacture, manure, and on-farm energy use and transportation, as well as the potential C sink arising from SOC sequestration. Across-farm SOC data showed a 4-year C sequestration rate of 3.59 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 in AMP grazed pastures. After including SOC in the GHG footprint estimates, finishing emissions from the AMP system were reduced from 9.62 to −6.65 kg CO2-e kg carcass weight (CW)−1, whereas FL emissions increased slightly from 6.09 to 6.12 kg CO2-e kg CW−1 due to soil erosion. This indicates that AMP grazing has the potential to offset GHG emissions through soil C sequestration, and therefore the finishing phase could be a net C sink. However, FL production required only half as much land as AMP grazing. While the SOC sequestration rates measured here were relatively high, lower rates would still reduce the AMP emissions relative to the FL emissions. This research suggests that AMP grazing can contribute to climate change mitigation through SOC sequestration and challenges existing conclusions that only feedlot-intensification reduces the overall beef GHG footprint through greater productivity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Stanley","given":"Paige L."},{"family":"Rowntree","given":"Jason E."},{"family":"Beede","given":"David K."},{"family":"DeLonge","given":"Marcia S."},{"family":"Hamm","given":"Michael W."}],"citation-key":"stanley2018","container-title":"Agricultural Systems","DOI":"10.1016/j.agsy.2018.02.003","ISSN":"0308521X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,1]]},"page":"249-258","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","title":"Impacts of soil carbon sequestration on life cycle greenhouse gas emissions in Midwestern USA beef finishing systems","type":"article-journal","volume":"162"},

Calves treated with TUL were 0.5 times [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.4 to 0.7] as likely to be treated for BRD60 as calves treated with TET. The objectives of the current study were to evaluate the long-term effects of BRD and antibiotic treatment on growth of heifers until breeding age, age at first calving, incidence of dystocia, milk production, and mortality before first calving and mortality before 120 d in milk. At entry to the breeding barn (382 d of age), calves that experienced BRD60 weighed 16.0±2.3 kg less than calves that did not. Survival to first calving was recorded for 98% (1,343/1,392) of the heifers on this trial. For TET and TUL heifers with BRD60, 63% (94/150) and 73% (64/88) survived to first lactation, respectively.

  {"id":"Steeneveld2013","abstract":"Shortening the dry period (DP) has been proposed as a management strategy to improve energy balance in early lactation. It is well known that both shortening and complete omission of the DP reduces milk production in the subsequent lactations. In most of these studies milk production data were obtained from planned animal experiments where cows were randomly assigned to DP length treatments, and cow management and diet composition did not differ among treatments. It may therefore be hypothesized that cows on commercial herds which apply a no-DP or short-DP-strategy, and support this by management adjustments, will have a less dramatic reduction in milk production. In this study, milk production and somatic cell count (SCC) following different DP lengths was investigated under commercial circumstances. Milk production of 342 cows (2,077 test-day records) was available from 5 Dutch commercial dairy herds which started a no DP-strategy for all cows. Test days of the year before applying the no-DP strategy are used as control (323 cows, 1,717 test-day records). Six other herds applied an individual cow approach and have different preplanned DP lengths within one herd. From these herds, information on 81 cows (482 test-day records) with a DP length between 0 and 20 d, 127 cows (925 test-day records) with a DP length between 21 and 35 d, and 143 cows (1,075 test-day records) with a DP length of more than 35 d was available. A generalized linear model incorporating an autoregressive covariance structure accounting for repeated test-day yields within cow was developed to estimate the daily yield (milk, fat and protein) and SCC of all cows. Applying no DP for all cows in the herd resulted in a reduction in postpartum milk production compared with within-herd control lactations (until 305 DIM) between 3.2 and 9.1 kg/d, which was a reduction of 12 and 32%, respectively. For the 6 herds that applied an individual cow approach with different preplanned DP lengths, the cow-specific DP strategy was based on milk production and SCC approximately 2 mo before calving. Cows with a preplanned DP length ranging between 0 and 20 d had a reduction in postpartum milk production between 5.7 and 13 kg/d compared with cows with a DP length of >35 d. Cows with a preplanned DP length ranging from 21 to 35 d had a numerically lower milk production (between 0.6 and 5.3 kg/d) than cows with a preplanned DP length of >35 d, but this difference was significant in only one herd. When corrected for milk yield, no difference in postpartum SCC for cows with different DP lengths was found.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Steeneveld","given":"W"},{"family":"Schukken","given":"Y H"},{"family":"Knegsel","given":"a T M","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Hogeveen","given":"H"}],"citation-key":"Steeneveld2013","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2012-6297","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,13]]},"page":"2988-3001","PMID":"23498000","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of different dry period lengths on milk production and somatic cell count in subsequent lactations on commercial Dutch dairy herds.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23498000","volume":"96"},

Seven biogenic amines were extracted from silages with perchloric acid and determined as N-benzamides by micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography. Common chemical quality parameters of silages were also determined. Tyramine, cadaverine and putrescine were the amines occurring at the highest concentration. As compared to untreated silages, formic acid was most effective to suppress formation of the main amines. Also the inoculants often decreased amine contents significantly (P < 0.05). The inoculants decreased levels of polyamine spermidine more efficiently than formic acid. Contents of histamine, tryptamine and polyamine spermine were very low, commonly below the detection limits.","author":[{"family":"Steidlová","given":"Š"},{"family":"Kalač","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"Steidlova2004","container-title":"Archives of Animal Nutrition","DOI":"10.1080/00039420410001701378","ISSN":"1745039X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"page":"245-254","title":"The effects of lactic acid bacteria inoculants and formic acid on the formation of biogenic amines in grass silages","type":"article-journal","volume":"58"},

  {"id":"Stella2003","abstract":"The objective of this study was to test for effects of gametic imprinting on litter size in swine by estimating variances for parent-specific gametic effects. Data were 64,047 and 137,009 multiparous records of number born alive for the U.S. Landrace and Yorkshire breeds, respectively. The statistical model included fixed effects of parity number and herd, and random effects of herd-year-season, mate, permanent environment, animal (additive genetic), and either maternal or paternal gametes. A Bayesian approach that used Gibbs sampling to obtain posterior distributions was employed. To aid in the interpretation of results, the Landrace data structure was used to simulate data with and without effects of imprinting. Analyses of the simulated records indicated that the model applied was capable of detecting effects of imprinting when such effects were present. Small, but non-zero, estimates of gametic variances were obtained when no imprinting was simulated. Estimates of the proportion of total variance accounted for by paternally transmitted gametes were 0.8 and 0.9% for Landrace and Yorkshires, respectively. These estimates were different from zero, but were similar to the results observed for data simulated without an imprinting effect. Corresponding results for maternally transmitted gametes were 1.6% for Landrace and 0.8% for Yorkshires. The estimate for Landrace was significantly greater than that observed for Yorkshires and for the simulations without a true effect and suggested the presence of a non-Mendelian genetic influence on litter size. Paternally imprinted genes are a plausible reason for the observed results. Assuming that the effect observed was due to paternal imprinting at a single biallelic locus, the substitution effect of the superior allele could be greater than 0.7 piglets per litter. Identification of a genetic marker for such an allele would be useful in marker-assisted selection of females. Other possible explanations exist for the increased gametic variance in the Landrace breed, but these explanations (such as maternal or cytoplasmic effects) may be less likely than paternal imprinting.","author":[{"family":"Stella","given":"a"},{"family":"Stalder","given":"K J"},{"family":"Saxton","given":"a M"},{"family":"Boettcher","given":"P J"}],"citation-key":"Stella2003","container-title":"Journal of animal science","ISSN":"0021-8812","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",9]]},"page":"2171-8","PMID":"12968691","title":"Estimation of variances for gametic effects on litter size in Yorkshire and Landrace swine.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12968691","volume":"81"},

  {"id":"sterk2011","abstract":"Nutritional guidelines promote a reduced intake of saturated fatty acids (FA) and increased intake of unsaturated FA by humans. Milk and dairy products contain a high proportion of saturated FA caused by extensive alterations of dietary lipids in the rumen through the processes of lipolysis and biohydrogenation. Therefore, marked differences exist between the FA profile in the diet (mostly unsaturated FA) and the FA profile of lipids leaving the rumen (mostly saturated FA). The objective of the research described in this thesis is therefore to improve the milk FA profile of dairy cows by altering diet composition and ruminal FA metabolism, thereby increasing ruminal outflow of unsaturated FA and consequently the secretion of unsaturated FA into milk fat. In the first study, a meta-analysis, it was shown that various fat sources, their technological form (oil, seed, protected, or addition of fish oil), and their inclusion to diets differing in forage type could significantly alter the FA profile of milk fat. In addition, the technological form of the fat source and the forage type in the basal diet affect the relationship between the dietary nutrient composition (FA and NDF content) and the milk FA profile. In the second study, various technologically and chemically treated linseed products were evaluated in vitro and it was shown that only formaldehyde treated crushed linseed and extruded whole linseed were able to decrease the extent of biohydrogenation of C18:3n3, whereas the addition of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to linseed oil inhibited the complete biohydrogenation to C18:0. In the third study, FA intake, omasal FA flows and plasma and milk FA profiles were measured from cows fed crushed linseed, formaldehyde treated linseed oil, extruded whole linseed, or linseed oil combined with DHA. The extent of biohydrogenation of C18:3n3 was lower for cows fed the extruded whole linseed treatment as shown by the higher omasal C18:3n3 flow compared with the other treatments. However, fat digestibility of this product was lower, resulting in no effects on plasma and milk C18:3n3 proportions. Cows fed formaldehyde treated linseed oil did show higher plasma and milk C18:3n3 proportions compared with the other treatments, but unsaturated FA content of milk fat did not differ between treatments. The cows fed linseed oil in combination with DHA showed increased omasal flows and plasma and milk fat proportions of biohydrogenation intermediates. In the final study, the milk FA profile of high producing dairy cows was evaluated after feeding an increasing proportion of crushed linseed in combination with varying forage type (grass versus maize silage) and forage to concentrate ratio. It was shown that the milk FA profile of cows fed an increasing proportion of crushed linseed depends on the forage type and forage to concentrate ratio of the diet. In conclusion, the results described in this thesis indicate that the FA profile of bovine milk fat can be altered by manipulation of the ration composition. Changes in ration composition affect ruminal FA metabolism, the profile of absorbed FA, and eventually the proportions of FA secreted in milk fat","author":[{"family":"Sterk","given":"Attje-rieke"}],"citation-key":"sterk2011","event-place":"Wageningen, The Netherlands","ISBN":"9789461730206","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"number-of-pages":"188","publisher":"Wageningen Universiteit","publisher-place":"Wageningen, The Netherlands","title":"Ruminal fatty acid metabolism","type":"thesis"},

  {"id":"Stinckens2010","abstract":"A QTL located in the paternally expressed insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene is known to increase muscle growth and reduce fat deposition in pigs. This makes the QTL in IGF2 a good marker for use in pig breeding programmes. However, care has to be taken as it is postulated that increased leanness and lowered fat deposition may have a negative effect on the prolificacy and longevity of sows. Selection of sire and dam lines for different alleles of the mutation in the paternally imprinted IGF2 gene could actually provide a solution to this problem. Therefore, in this study, the effect of the IGF2 QTL on prolificacy-related traits in sows was investigated. It was found that the paternal IGF2 wild-type allele was associated with higher reproduction performance in the sow. Moreover, it was also examined whether the difference in prolificacy in sows could be a consequence of differential IGF2 expression in the ovarian follicles of the sow or whether it is mainly a secondary effect caused by differences in fatness traits. Therefore, IGF2 expression was measured in follicles of different sizes from sows with different genotypes for the paternal IGF2 allele. It was observed that, however, while the size of the follicles was associated with follicular IGF2 expression level, the IGF2 genotype was not. It could be concluded that the difference in prolificacy of sows with a different paternal IGF2 genotype could be a secondary effect, resulting from differences in fat deposition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Stinckens","given":"a"},{"family":"Mathur","given":"P"},{"family":"Janssens","given":"S"},{"family":"Bruggeman","given":"V"},{"family":"Onagbesan","given":"O M"},{"family":"Schroyen","given":"M"},{"family":"Spincemaille","given":"G"},{"family":"Decuypere","given":"E"},{"family":"Georges","given":"M"},{"family":"Buys","given":"N"}],"citation-key":"Stinckens2010","container-title":"Animal genetics","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2052.2010.02040.x","ISSN":"1365-2052","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",10]]},"page":"493-8","PMID":"20394605","title":"Indirect effect of IGF2 intron3 g.3072G>A mutation on prolificacy in sows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20394605","volume":"41"},
  {"id":"Stocks2013","abstract":"We previously showed that propionic acid was more hypophagic than acetic acid when infused intraruminally in cows in the postpartum period and that the degree of hypophagia from short-term propionic acid infusion (18 h) was related to the acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) concentration in the liver. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate adaptation over time with longer-term infusions over 3 d. Twelve multiparous cows (2-13 d postpartum) were blocked by calving date and assigned randomly to treatment sequence in a crossover design experiment. The experiment was 12 d long with covariate periods preceding each 3-d infusion period. Treatments were 1.0 M propionic acid or 1.0 M acetic acid, infused intraruminally at 0.5 mol of volatile fatty acids/h beginning 6 h before feeding and continuing for 78 h with 3 d between infusions. Propionic acid decreased dry matter intake (DMI) relative to acetic acid (15.9 vs. 17.0 kg/d). However, a period-by- treatment interaction was detected for DMI. During period 1, propionic acid decreased DMI relative to acetic acid (14.3 vs. 17.5 kg/d) because of a reduction in meal size (1.30 vs. 1.65 kg), with no effect on intermeal interval. Propionic acid decreased DMI over the first 4 h following feeding (5.86 vs. 8.23 kg) but did not affect DMI 4 to 24 h after feeding. The depression in DMI in period 1 was positively related to hepatic acetyl-CoA concentration during the covariate period. Propionic acid was increasingly more hypophagic than acetic acid as hepatic acetyl-CoA concentration was elevated. No treatment-by-day interaction for DMI was observed, suggesting little or no measurable adaptation to treatment over the 3-d infusion period. These results suggest that hypophagia from propionic acid is enhanced when hepatic acetyl-CoA concentrations are elevated, such as when cows are in a lipolytic state. © 2013 American Dairy Science Association.","author":[{"family":"Stocks","given":"S.

  {"id":"Sulzberger2016","abstract":"Oral supplementation of clay has been reported to function as buffer in dairy cows. However, its effects on rumen, blood, and fecal pH have varied among studies. Our objective was to determine the effects of 3 concentrations of dietary clay supplementation after a grain challenge. Ten multiparous rumen-cannulated Holstein cows [body weight (mean ± standard deviation) = 648 ± 12 kg] with 142 ± 130 (60 to 502) days in milk were assigned to 1 of 5 treatments in a replicated 5 × 5 Latin square design balanced to measure carryover effects. Periods (21 d) were divided into an adaptation phase (d 1 to 18, with regular total mixed ration fed ad libitum) and a measurement phase (d 19 to 21). Feed was restricted on d 18 to 75% of the average of the total mixed ration fed from d 15 to 17 (dry matter basis), and on d 19 cows received a grain challenge. The challenge consisted of 20% finely ground wheat administered into the rumen via a rumen cannula, based on the average dry matter intake obtained on d 15 to 17. Treatments were POS (no clay plus a grain challenge), 3 different concentrations of clay (0.5, 1, or 2% of dietary dry matter intake), and control (C; no clay and no grain challenge). Statistical analysis was performed using the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Contrasts 1 (POS vs. C) and 2 (POS vs. the average of 0.5, 1, or 2%) were compared, along with linear and quadratic treatment effects. Rumen, fecal, and blood pH, along with blood metabolites, were measured at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, and 48 h relative to the grain challenge. Cows fed POS had lower rumen pH [(mean ± standard error) 6.03 ± 0.06] than cows fed C (6.20 ± 0.06). Cow fed POS had lower fecal pH (6.14 ± 0.04) than cows fed C (6.38 ± 0.04). We observed a linear treatment effect for rumen pH and fecal pH. Fecal pH (6.22 ± 0.04) was higher for cows fed clay (contrast 2) then for cows fed POS (6.14 ± 0.04). We also observed a treatment difference (contrast 2) for negative incremental area under the curve, pH below 5.6 × h/d, (0.5% clay = 7.93 ± 0.83, 1% clay = 8.56 ± 0.83, and 2% clay = 7.79 ± 0.83) compared with POS (11.0 ± 0.83). Cows fed clay tended to have higher milk yield (0.5% clay = 28.8 ± 3.4 kg, 1% clay = 30.2 ± 3.4 kg, and 2% clay = 29.1 ± 3.4 kg, contrast 2), and had higher 3.5% fat-corrected milk (0.5% clay = 29.9 ± 3.5 kg, 1% clay = 34.1 ± 3.5 kg, and 2% clay = 33.1 ± 3.4 kg), and higher energy-corrected milk (0.5% clay = 29.1 ± 3.3 kg, 1% clay = 32.8 ± 3.4 kg, and 2% clay = 31.6 ± 3.3 kg) than cows fed POS (27.7 ± 3.4 kg, 28.0 ± 3.4 kg, 27.7 ± 3.3 kg, respectively).

In the second survey, corn silage samples were collected from 11 farms that did not inoculate their silages and from 11 farms that applied a Pioneer 11CFT inoculant (L. buchneri strain LN40177; Pioneer Hi-Bred International). Inoculants were applied directly through self-propelled forage harvesters, at the recommended rate of 1 g/t of fresh forage, to achieve a final application rate of 1.0 × 10(5) cfu/g of L. buchneri. One corn bunker silo, which had been open for at least 10 d, was examined in detail on each farm. The silages inoculated with L. buchneri had lower concentrations of lactic acid, a lower lactic-to-acetic acid ratio, a lower yeast count, and higher aerobic stability compared with the untreated silages. Unexpectedly, concentrations of acetic acid and 1,2-propanediol, 2 hallmarks of L. buchneri activity, did not differ between treatments and were only numerically higher in the inoculated silages compared with untreated ones, in both surveys. Aerobic stability, on average, was 107 and 121 h in the inoculated silages and 64 and 74 h in the untreated silages, for surveys 1 and 2, respectively, and decreased exponentially as the yeast count in the silage at the time of sampling increased, regardless of treatment. Inoculation with L. buchneri proved to be effective in reducing the yeast count to <2 log cfu/g of silage in 16 of 21 of the studied farm silages, confirming the ability of this inoculum to enhance the aerobic stability of corn silages in farm bunker silos.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Tabacco","given":"E"},{"family":"Piano","given":"S"},{"family":"Revello-Chion","given":"a"},{"family":"Borreani","given":"G"}],"citation-key":"Tabacco2011","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2011-4286","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",11]]},"page":"5589-98","PMID":"22032382","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effect of Lactobacillus buchneri LN4637 and Lactobacillus buchneri LN40177 on the aerobic stability, fermentation products, and microbial populations of corn silage under farm conditions.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22032382","volume":"94"},
  {"id":"Tabacco2011a","abstract":"The economic damage that results from aerobic deterioration of silage is a significant problem for farm profitability and feed quality. This paper quantifies the dry matter (DM) and nutritional losses that occur during the exposure of corn and sorghum silages to air over 14 d and assesses the possibility of enhancing the aerobic stability of silages through inoculation with lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The trial was carried out in Northern Italy on corn (50% milk line) and grain sorghum (early dough stage) silages. The crops were ensiled in 30-L jars, without a LAB inoculant (C), with a Lactobacillus plantarum inoculum (LP), and with a Lactobacillus buchneri inoculum (LB; theoretical rate of 1 × 10(6) cfu/g of fresh forage). The pre-ensiled material, the silage at silo opening, and the aerobically exposed silage were analyzed for DM content, fermentative profiles, yeast and mold count, starch, crude protein, ash, fiber components, 24-h and 48-h DM digestibility and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) degradability. The yield and nutrient analysis data of the corn and sorghum silages were used as input for Milk2006 to estimate the total digestible nutrients, net energy of lactation, and milk production per Mg of DM. The DM fermentation and respiration losses were also calculated. The inocula influenced the in vitro NDF digestibility at 24h, the net energy for lactation (NE(L)), and the predicted milk yield per megagram of DM, whereas the length of time of air exposure influenced DM digestibility at 24 and 48 h, the NE(L), and the predicted milk yield per megagram of DM in the corn silages. The inocula only influenced the milk yield per megagram of DM and the air exposure affected the DM digestibility at 24h, the NE(L), and the milk yield per megagram of DM in the sorghum silages. The milk yield, after 14 d of air exposure, decreased to 1,442, 1,418, and 1,277 kg/Mg of DM for C, LB, and LP corn silages, respectively, compared with an average value of 1,568 kg of silage at opening. In the sorghum silages, the milk yield, after 14 d of air exposure, decreased to 1,226, 1,278, and 1,250 kg/Mg of DM for C, LB, and LP, respectively. When the estimated milk yield per megagram of harvested DM of corn and sorghum silage were related to mold count, it was shown that the loss of potential milk production occurred when the mold count exceeded 4 log cfu/g of silage, and it was almost halved when the mold count reached values greater than 8 log cfu/g of silage. Inoculation with L. buchneri, at a rate of 1 × 10(6) cfu/g of fresh forage, enhanced the stability of the silage after exposure to air, and, consequently, contributed to maintaining the nutritional value of the harvested forage over time, for air exposure up to 7 d.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Tabacco","given":"E"},{"family":"Righi","given":"F"},{"family":"Quarantelli","given":"a"},{"family":"Borreani","given":"G"}],"citation-key":"Tabacco2011a","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2010-3538","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",3]]},"page":"1409-19","PMID":"21338806","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Dry matter and nutritional losses during aerobic deterioration of corn and sorghum silages as influenced by different lactic acid bacteria inocula.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21338806","volume":"94"},

They were stored in incubator at 26 ??C for 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. This was used to estimate the extent of urea hydrolysis and nitrogen retention. The second experiment measured the outflow rate of ammonia by blowing in air through treated straw into dilute H2SO4. The third experiment assessed the ability of grass and citrus pulp silages in holding ammonia. Urea hydrolysis was extensive (90-100%) but independent of moisture and treatment period (P > 0.05). About 74% of nitrogen added in the form of urea in treated straw was lost during aeration. Fermentation enhanced the ammonia holding capacity of citrus pulp. This was further improved with time and addition of molasses. It's nitrogen content was increased from 11.7 to 21.2 g kg-1 DM. This decreased to 16.0 g kg-1 DM about 5 h after gassing.

  {"id":"Tajkarimi2008","abstract":"Animal feeds may be contaminated, accidentally or maliciously, with a number of zoonotic bacteria. Animal infections with these bacterial agents, whether or not they cause animal disease, may lead to human illnesses. Anhydrous ammonia was introduced on farms in developed countries as a high-nitrogen soil amendment, but later found use in enhancing crude protein in low-quality roughage fed to ruminants and in neutralizing mycotoxins in fungus-infested feed grains. Although ammonia has been known to be effective against bacteria in other contexts (e.g., manure, community sewage sludge, seeds for sprouting, and boneless lean beef trimmings), it appears that the antibacterial effect of ammoniating animal feeds had not been tested. In the present study, samples of roughage (wheat straw, corn silage) and concentrates (corn grain, cottonseed) produced as animal feed were contaminated with dried-on zoonotic bacteria (Salmonella Newport in all; Campylobacte jejuni, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica in corn grain only). Disinfection with anhydrous ammonia gas was conducted for 24 h at room temperature (∼ 25 °C). The treatment was least effective in silage because the silage alone showed strong antibacterial activity, which may have been slightly reduced by ammoniation. In the other three feeds, depending on the initial level of contamination, ammonia destruction of ≥ 5 log 10 cfu/g (99.999%) of the selected contaminant was usually observed. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

  {"id":"TAMMINGA1991","abstract":"Degradation in the rumen of dairy cows of nitrogenous compounds in 35 grass silages and 12 grass hays was studied by means of the nylon bag incubation technique. Silages varied in dry matter content, crude protein content and date of harvesting; hays varied mainly in crude protein content. Measurements in both forages were washable (W), degradable (D) and undegradable fraction (U) and rate of degradation (ks) of D. W and U were measured as the residue after washing without incubating (W) or after 336 h in the rumen (U). N escape (E) was calculated from these data, assuming a ruminal passage rate of 4.5% per hour. E (N escape from the rumen) in hays was substantially higher than in silages, mainly because a large proportion of N compounds in silage became soluble during the ensiling process. Of the total variation in E, around 80% could be explained in both forages. In silage, E was positively influenced by dry matter content, negatively by crude protein content and positively by the number of days elapsed since 1 April. This effect of day of harvesting was mainly through an increase of U and may not be beneficial to the animal.

  {"id":"Tamminga1994a","abstract":"In 1991 a new protein evaluation system replaced the Digestible Crude Protein (DCP) system in the Netherlands: the DVE/OEB-system. The system was mainly developed with the aim to prevent avoidable losses of nitrogen, by feeding according to more exactly defined requirements of dairy cows. A second aim was to predict milk protein production more accurately. Protein requirements for maintenance, milk protein production, growth, mobilisation, metabolic losses in the digestive tract and gestation are expressed in DVE, the sum of digestible feed and microbial true protein available in the small intestine. In the system each feed has a DVE-value composed of the digestible true protein contributed by feed protein escaping rumen degradation (1), microbial protein synthesized in the rumen (2) and a correction for endogenous protein losses in the digestive tract (3). Each feed also has a degraded protein balance (OEB) reflecting the difference between the potential microbial protein synthesis based on degraded feed crude protein and that based on energy available for microbial fermentation in the rumen. The framework of the new system is based on what are considered strong elements of other recently developed protein evaluation systems. Additionally new elements are introduced, including undegraded starch (USTA), fermentation products (FP) in ensiled feeds, the role of energy balance in protein supply and the way in which requirements change in the course of lactation. Data within the framework of the system are mainly of Dutch origin. This is particularly true for the regression equations developed to predict the protein values of forages and protein values of a number of by-product ingredients.","author":[{"family":"Tamminga","given":"S"},{"family":"Van Straalen","given":"WM"},{"family":"Subnel","given":"Apj P J"},{"family":"Meijer","given":"Rgm G M"},{"family":"Steg","given":"A"},{"family":"Wever","given":"Cjg"},{"family":"Blok","given":"MC"},{"family":"Straalen","given":"W M Van"},{"family":"Subnel","given":"Apj P J"},{"family":"Meijer","given":"Rgm G M"},{"family":"Steg","given":"A"}],"citation-key":"Tamminga1994a","container-title":"Livestock Production Science","ISSN":"03016226","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1994"]]},"page":"139-155","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"The Dutch protein evaluation system : the DVE / OEB-system","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0301622694900434","volume":"40"},
  {"id":"Tamminga2006","abstract":"Reproduction in dairy cattle is negatively affected by a negative energy balance (NEB), a combination of the deposition or mobilisation of fat and protein. The mode of action of NEB on fertility is not always clear, but the severity, length, and probably also the nature of the NEB may be involved. Extensive mobilisation of fat is expected to have detrimental effects on liver function due to the accumulation of non-esterified long chain fatty acids, impairing the detoxification of ammonia into urea. Protein evaluation systems nowadays use the concept of metabolisable protein (MP) and distinguish between rumen degradable protein (RDP) and rumen undegradable protein (RUP). Mobilisation of protein itself does not seem to have negative effects on reproduction. However, when protein is extensively degraded in the rumen or used as an energy source, metabolic residues like ammonia and urea will result. Such residues may exert metabolic effects that are often detrimental to reproduction and fertility. Ammonia is believed to play a role starting before ovulation, whereas urea mainly interferes negatively after fertilisation. But, urea is also believed to aggravate the severity of NEB and its effect on fertility by preventing or delaying the start of cyclicity. Besides, urea has been shown to lower the pH in the uterine fluid, giving rise to disturbances in follicular development and embryonic growth. It is recommended to limit the level of rumen degradable protein in the diet to 10% in the DM. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, the cellular mechanisms involved in the depressed mammary gland function remain unknown. The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of heat stress during the dry period on various indices of mammary gland development of multiparous cows. Cows were dried off approximately 46 d before expected calving and randomly assigned to 2 treatments, heat stress (HT, n = 15) or cooling (CL, n = 14), based on mature equivalent milk production. Cows in the CL treatment were provided with sprinklers and fans that came on when ambient temperatures reached 21.1°C, whereas HT cows were housed in the same barn without fans and sprinklers. After parturition, all cows were housed in a freestall barn with cooling. Rectal temperatures were measured twice daily (0730 and 1430. h) and respiration rates recorded at 1500. h on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule from dry off to calving. Milk yield and composition were recorded daily up to 280 d in milk. Daily dry matter intake was measured from dry off to 42 d relative to calving. Mammary biopsies were collected at dry off, -20, 2, and 20 d relative to calving from a subset of cows (HT, n = 7; CL, n = 7). Labeling with Ki67 antigen and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling were used to evaluate mammary cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. The average temperature-humidity index during the dry period was 76.6 and not different between treatments. Heat-stressed cows had higher rectal temperatures in the morning (38.8 vs. 38.6°C) and afternoon (39.4 vs. 39.0°C), greater respiration rates (78.4 vs. 45.6 breath/min), and decreased dry matter intake (8.9 vs. 10.6. kg/d) when dry compared with CL cows. Relative to HT cows, CL cows had greater milk production (28.9 vs. 33.9. kg/d), lower milk protein concentration (3.01 vs. 2.87%), and tended to have lower somatic cell score (3.35 vs. 2.94) through 280 d in milk. Heat stress during the dry period decreased mammary cell proliferation rate (1.0 vs. 3.3%) at -20 d relative to calving compared with CL cows. Mammary cell apoptosis was not affected by prepartum heat stress. We conclude that heat stress during the dry period compromises mammary gland development before parturition, which decreases milk yield in the next lactation. © 2011 American Dairy Science Association.","author":[{"family":"Tao","given":"S."},{"family":"Bubolz","given":"J.

  {"id":"Tao2013","abstract":"In dairy cattle, late gestation is a critical period for fetal growth and physiological transition into the next lactation. Environmental factors, such as temperature and light, exert dramatic effects on the production, health, and well-being of animals during this period and after parturition. The aim of this review was to introduce effects of heat stress during late gestation on dairy cattle, and discuss the biological mechanisms that underlie the observed production and health responses in the dam and her fetus. Relative to cooled cows, cows that are heat stressed during late gestation have impaired mammary growth before parturition and decreased milk production in the subsequent lactation. In response to higher milk yield, cows cooled prepartum undergo a series of homeorhetic adaptations in early lactation to meet higher demand for milk synthesis compared with heat-stressed cows, but no direct effect of environmental heat stress on metabolism exists during the dry period. Prepartum cooling improves immune status of transition cows and evidence suggests that altered prolactin signaling in immune cells mediates the effects of heat stress on immune function. Late-gestation heat stress compromises placental development, which results in fetal hypoxia, malnutrition, and eventually fetal growth retardation. Maternal heat stress may also have carryover effects on the postnatal growth of offspring, but direct evidence is still lacking. Emerging evidence suggests that offspring from prepartum heat-stressed cows have compromised passive immunity and impaired cell-mediated immune function compared with those from cooled cows. © 2013 American Dairy Science Association.","author":[{"family":"Tao","given":"S."},{"family":"Dahl","given":"G.

The hypothesis was 2 sided; therefore, the hypothesis was that the new agent would be better or worse compared with the industry gold standard footbath agents, formalin and copper sulfate. The study was conducted in a large commercial dairy farm located near Ithaca, New York, from June 18, 2009 to October 26, 2009. Two identical studies were conducted, the first comparing Dragonhyde (5% solution, twice weekly) and formalin (5% solution, twice weekly) and the second comparing Dragonhyde (5% solution, twice weekly) and copper sulfate (10% solution, twice weekly). The study design was identical for both studies with 4 pens (physically identical), 2 treatments (Dragonhyde vs. formalin and Dragonhyde vs. copper sulfate), 2 periods (crossing over the treatment within pen), and 3 repeated measures (3 observations per cow: enrollment, wk 2, and wk 4). For study 1, 406 cows were enrolled (n=201 formalin and 205 Dragonhyde). For study 2, 356 cows were enrolled (n=189 copper sulfate and 167 Dragonhyde). The adjusted odds of digital dermatitis lesion (DDL) throughout the study period were analyzed by mixed logistic regression model. In study 1, the odds of DDL were 1.36 times higher for the formalin group compared with the Dragonhyde group. In study 2, the data were analyzed by a similar statistical model and the variable treatment did not significantly affect the overall prevalence of DDL.

  {"id":"tepasBiochemicalPathwaysAnalysis2007","abstract":"Background. Combining microarray results and biological pathway information will add insight into biological processes. Pathway information is widely available in databases through the internet. Mammalian muscle formation has been previously studied using microarray technology in pigs because these animals are an interesting animal model for muscle formation due to selection for increased muscle mass. Results indicated regulation of the expression of genes involved in proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts, and energy metabolism. The aim of the present study was to analyse microarrays studying myogenesis in pigs. It was necessary to develop methods to search biochemical pathways databases. Results. PERL scripts were developed that used the names of the genes on the microarray to search databases. Synonyms of gene names were added to the list by searching the Gene Ontology database. The KEGG database was searched for pathway information using this updated gene list. The KEGG database returned 88 pathways. Most genes were found in a single pathway, but others were found in up to seven pathways. Combining the pathways and the microarray information 21 pathways showed sufficient information content for further analysis. These pathways were related to regulation of several steps in myogenesis and energy metabolism. Pathways regulating myoblast proliferation and muscle fibre formation were described. Furthermore, two networks of pathways describing the formation of the myoblast cytoskeleton and regulation of the energy metabolism during myogenesis were presented. Conclusion. Combining microarray results and pathways information available through the internet provide biological insight in how the process of porcine myogenesis is regulated. ? 2007 te Pas et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","author":[{"family":"Te Pas","given":"M.F.W."},{"family":"Hulsegge","given":"I."},{"family":"Coster","given":"A."},{"family":"Pool","given":"M.H."},{"family":"Heuven","given":"H.H."},{"family":"Janss","given":"L.L.G."}],"citation-key":"tepasBiochemicalPathwaysAnalysis2007","container-title":"BMC Developmental Biology","DOI":"10.1186/1471-213X-7-66","ISSN":"1471213X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"title":"Biochemical pathways analysis of microarray results: Regulation of myogenesis in pigs","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"Terre2015","abstract":"Two experiments were conducted to assess the effect of physical form of a starter feed with or without straw supplementation on growth performance of Holstein calves. In experiment 1, a total of 32 calves were randomly assigned at 7 d of age to texturized starter feed (containing rolled barley, corn, and oats) without straw, texturized starter feed with chopped straw, and pelleted starter feed with chopped straw. All calves were offered 4 L of pasteurized whole milk twice daily from 7 to 35 d of age, 2 L of milk twice daily from 36 to 42 d of age, and 2 L of milk from 43 to 49 d of age. Animals were weaned at 50 d of age, and the study finished when calves were 63 d old. In experiment 2, a total of 60 calves (8 d of age) were randomly assigned to texturized starter feed (containing whole corn) without straw, pelleted starter feed without straw, and pelleted starter feed with chopped straw. All calves were offered the same milk replacer (MR; 23% crude protein and 19.5 fat) at 11% dry matter concentration, 4 L/d of MR until 14 d of age, 6 L/d of MR from 14 to 37 d, 3 L/d of MR from 38 to 44 d, and 1.5 L/d of MR from 45 to 52 d of age. The experiment finished when calves were 58 d old (1 wk after weaning). Rumen liquid pH was measured after weaning. In both studies, calves were individually housed in pens on sawdust bedding and starter feed and chopped straw were offered free choice in separate buckets. In experiment 1, starter feed and straw intake and growth did not differ among treatments. However, calves receiving straw showed a greater rumen pH compared with those not receiving straw. In experiment 2, pelleted started feed supplemented with straw fostered an increase in solid feed intake (as percentage of body weight) compared with a pelleted or texturized starter feed without straw supplementation. However, calves that received the texturized starter feed containing whole corn had rumen pH similar to those fed a pelleted starter feed with straw. Feeding a texturized starter feed containing rolled barley, corn, and oats (with or without straw provision) was not able to maintain rumen pH or promote growth and intake compared with offering a pelleted starter feed with chopped straw. However, when whole corn was used in the texturized starter feed, rumen pH was equivalent to that obtained with a pelleted starter feed and straw supplementation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Terré","given":"M"},{"family":"Castells","given":"Ll"},{"family":"Khan","given":"M A"},{"family":"Bach","given":"A"}],"citation-key":"Terre2015","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2014-8151","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,2]]},"language":"English","page":"1101-9","PMID":"25497821","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Interaction between the physical form of the starter feed and straw provision on growth performance of Holstein calves.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022030214008273/fulltext","volume":"98"},

  {"id":"thomasFeedingRumenprotectedLysine2022","abstract":"Providing adequate concentrations of AA in the prepartum diet is pivotal for the cow's health and performance. However, less is known about the potential in utero effects of particular AA on early-life performance of calves. This experiment was conducted to determine the effects on dairy calves when their dams were fed rumen-protected lysine (RPL; AjiPro-L Generation 3, Ajinomoto Heartland Inc.; 0.54% dry matter of total mixed ration as top dress) from 26 ± 4.6 d (mean ± standard deviation) before calving until calving. Seventy-eight male (M) and female (F) Holstein calves were assigned to 2 treatments based on their dams' prepartum treatment, RPL supplementation (PRE-L) or without RPL (CON). At the time of birth (0.5–2 h after calving), before colostrum was fed, blood samples were collected. An initial body weight was obtained at 1 to 3 h after birth. Calves were fed 470 g of colostrum replacer (Land O'Lakes Bovine IgG Colostrum Replacer, Land O'Lakes, Inc.) diluted in 3.8 L of water. Calves were provided water ad libitum and fed milk replacer (Advance Excelerate, Milk Specialties Global Animal Nutrition; 28.5% crude protein, 15% fat) at 0600 h and 1700 h until 42 d of age. Calves were measured weekly, at weaning (d 42), and at the end of the experimental period (d 56). Plasma concentrations of AA were measured on d 0, 7, and 14 d using ultra-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (Waters) with a derivatization method (AccQ-Tag Derivatization). Final body weight was greater for M (87 ± 11 kg) than F (79 ± 7 kg). Calves in PRE-L tended to have greater dry matter (814 ± 3 g/d) and crude protein (234 ± 6 g/d) intakes than those in CON (793 ± 9 g/d and 228 ± 11 g/d, respectively). Calves in PRE-L had greater average daily gain (0.96 ± 0.04 kg/d) than calves in CON (0.85 ± 0.03 kg/d) during wk 6 to 8. Calves in PRE-L tended to be medicated fewer days than CON (4.7 ± 1.2 d vs. 6.2 ± 3.4 d, respectively). Calves in PRE-L-M and CON-F (2,916 ± 112 µM and 2,848 ± 112 µM, respectively) had greater total AA concentration in plasma than calves in PRE-L-F and CON-M (2,684 ± 112 µM and 2,582 ± 112 µM, respectively). Calves in PRE-L-F and CON-M (4.09 ± 0.11% and 4.16 ± 0.11%, respectively) had greater concentration of Lys as a percentage of total AA compared with calves in CON-F and PRE-L-M (3.91 ± 0.11% and 3.90 ± 0.11%, respectively). Calves in PRE-L tended to have greater percentage of phagocytic neutrophils (39.6 ± 1.59%) than calves in CON (35.9 ± 1.59%). In conclusion, increasing the metabolizable lysine provided to prepartum dairy cows had modest effect over offspring performance, with the major result being a greater average daily gain for calves in PRE-L during the preweaning phase (wk 6–8).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Thomas","given":"B.

Dairy cows were injected with vitamin E and selenium (Se) in one study; beef cows were offered oral vitamin E supplementation via a free-choice vitamin- mineral mix in two studies. Breed-related effects were also evaluated. Jerseys had higher blood Se and lower serum vitamin E concentrations than Holsteins at dry-off and higher blood Se concentrations than Holsteins 3-4 weeks pre-calving and at calving. Selenium supplementation increased blood Se concentrations at calving. Treatment did not affect serum vitamin E concentrations at calving or post-calving, nor blood Se concentrations post-calving. Beef cattle consuming supplemental vitamin E (treatment) had greater responses to treatment when calving in late winter than when calving in late summer. Treated multiparous cows calving in winter had increased serum and colostral vitamin E concentrations but treatment did not affect colostral or serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations of their calves. Calves from treated, multiparous cows calving in winter had increased 205-day adjusted weaning weights (AWWs). Treatment did not affect colostral vitamin E or IgG concentrations of nulliparous heifers calving in winter, nor serum vitamin E or IgG concentrations, or AWWs of their calves.

To determine the effects of seasonal heat stress during the dry period on subsequent lactation performance, occurrence of health disorders during the first 80 DIM, and reproduction performance during the first 150 DIM, records of 2,613 multiparous cows under commercial conditions in Florida over 3 yr were analyzed. Seasons were COOL (December, January, and February) and HOT (June, July, and August). Traits analyzed were lactation number, 305-d milk production, calving interval, number of breedings, days open, and occurrence of postpartum health disorders such as digestive problems, mastitis, metritis, retained fetal membranes, and respiratory problems. Cows dry during HOT months had less milk yield in the subsequent lactation relative to COOL cows (10,351 vs. 10,902 kg; P < 0.01). Additionally, HOT cows had a greater incidence of mastitis (P < 0.01) and respiratory problems (P < 0.01) compared with COOL cows. Moreover, cows exposed to heat tended to have a greater incidence of retained fetal membrane (P < 0.06) compared with cows cooled while dry. Of interest, COOL cows had a greater incidence of postpartum digestive problems (P < 0.01). Additionally, cows dried during hot months had increased breeding number (P = 0.03), DIM to first breeding (P < 0.01), and DIM to pregnancy diagnosis (P < 0.01) in the subsequent lactation. Therefore, environmental-management strategies during the dry period may be needed to attain optimal lactation performance.","author":[{"family":"Thompson","given":"I.

  {"id":"Thomsen2012","abstract":"The objectives of this study were to develop and test a system for automatic washing of the hooves of dairy cows and to evaluate the effect of frequent automatic washing on the prevalence of digital dermatitis (DD). An automatic hoof washer was developed in an experimental dairy herd and tested in 6 commercial dairy herds in 2 experiments (1 and 2). In the experimental herd, automatic hoof washing resulted in cleaner hooves. In experiments 1 and 2, cows were washed after each milking on the left side only, leaving the right side unwashed as a within-cow control. In experiment 1, hooves were washed with a water and 0.4% soap solution. In experiment 2, hooves were washed with water only. In each experiment, DD was scored in a hoof-trimming chute approximately 60 d after the start of hoof washing. Data were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model. The outcome was the DD status of each leg (DD positive or DD negative). Herd and cow within herd were included as random effects, and treatment (washing or control) was included as a fixed effect. The statistical analyses showed that the odds ratio of having DD was 1.48 in the control leg compared with the washed leg in experiment 1. In experiment 2, the odds ratio of having DD was 1.27 in the control leg compared with the washed leg. We concluded that automatic washing of hooves with water and soap can help decrease the prevalence of DD in commercial dairy herds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Thomsen","given":"Peter T"},{"family":"Ersbøll","given":"Annette Kjær"},{"family":"Sørensen","given":"Jan Tind"}],"citation-key":"Thomsen2012","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2011-5171","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",12]]},"page":"7195-9","PMID":"23063150","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Short communication: Automatic washing of hooves can help control digital dermatitis in dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23063150","volume":"95"},

The results showed that the loss of vitamin A in TMR under different fermentation conditions differed signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05). The increase in moisture level and temperature led to an increase in vitamin A loss, with the greatest loss of up to 68.5% when the moisture level of TMR was 600 g/kg and the storage temperature was 40 ◦C. In addition, there was a signiﬁcant correlation (p < 0.05) between lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and aerobic bacteria and vitamin A content throughout the fermentation process, thus LAB and aerobic bacteria were associated with vitamin A loss. Thus, a coupling effect of LAB and aerobic bacteria lead to the loss of vitamin A in TMR silage under acidic conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Tian","given":"Pengjiao"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Huiying"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiya"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Mingqing"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiqing"}],"citation-key":"tian2023","container-title":"Fermentation","container-title-short":"Fermentation","DOI":"10.3390/fermentation9070614","ISSN":"2311-5637","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,28]]},"language":"en","page":"614","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effects of Temperature and Moisture Levels on Vitamin A in Total Mixed Ration Silage","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2311-5637/9/7/614","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"Totir2009","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Marginal posterior genotype probabilities need to be computed for genetic analyses such as geneticcounseling in humans and selective breeding in animal and plant species. METHODS: In this paper, we describe a peeling based, deterministic, exact algorithm to compute efficiently genotype probabilities for every member of a pedigree with loops without recourse to junction-tree methods from graph theory. The efficiency in computing the likelihood by peeling comes from storing intermediate results in multidimensional tables called cutsets. Computing marginal genotype probabilities for individual i requires recomputing the likelihood for each of the possible genotypes of individual i. This can be done efficiently by storing intermediate results in two types of cutsets called anterior and posterior cutsets and reusing these intermediate results to compute the likelihood. EXAMPLES: A small example is used to illustrate the theoretical concepts discussed in this paper, and marginal genotype probabilities are computed at a monogenic disease locus for every member in a real cattle pedigree.","author":[{"family":"Totir","given":"Liviu R"},{"family":"Fernando","given":"Rohan L"},{"family":"Abraham","given":"Joseph"}],"citation-key":"Totir2009","container-title":"Genetics, selection, evolution : GSE","DOI":"10.1186/1297-9686-41-52","ISSN":"1297-9686","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",1]]},"page":"52","PMID":"19958551","title":"An efficient algorithm to compute marginal posterior genotype probabilities for every member of a pedigree with loops.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2801663&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"Trevisi2008","abstract":"Infections, as well as many other noxious factors, cause the release of several mediators (i.e. pro-inflammatory cytokines) through leukocytes and tissue cells that promote both a local and a systemic response: i.e. the acute phase response or inflammation. Together with fever, anorexia, endocrine and metabolic changes producing catabolic effects, cytokines (IL-1 and TNF-α) are responsible for a peculiar phenomenon: the liver production of positive acute-phase proteins, which can compete with the production of usual liver proteins (negative acute-phase proteins are in fact reduced). Consequently, the inflammatory events reduce the liver functionality. Nevertheless, this effect becomes critical when the liver is overcharged. In dairy cows this occurs immediately before and after calving when protein and fat storages are mobilized to cover nutrient deficiency and liver, the site of gluconeogenesis and of fatty acids metabolism, is heavily engaged. During the periparturient period, other causes can be responsible of cytokine release: injuries and trauma during calving, mammary gland oedema, uterus involution, calving stress. These perhaps explain the extremely frequent occurrence of inflammatory events in periparturient cows, no matter if they show any clinical sign (of infectious or metabolic diseases) or not. These conditions are characterized by the typical blood changes, i.e. an increase of some acute-phase proteins and a reduction of functionally important liver proteins (i.e. albumins, lipoproteins andretinol binding protein) that seem associated to a worsening of cow performances (i.e. higher weight loss, lower milk yield and decrease in fertility). Attempts to reduce the effects of inflammation around calving through treatments with cyclooxygenase antagonists, have shown encouraging results. In particular, the administration by injection or orally of acetylsalicylate during the first days of lactation has lowered the plasma inflammatory indices (positive acute-phase proteins) and, simultaneously, has maintained the proper synthesis of usual liver proteins, suggesting a better liver functionality. In addition, milk yield, somatic cell count and reproductive performance (46% of cows pregnant after 1st insemination vs. 18% of control) has been significantly improved. These results evidence the high frequency of cytokine release around calving, even in apparently healthy cows, and confirm that the inhibition of some cytokine effects (i.e. eicosanoid production) could be an efficient approach to improve the the health status of dairy cattle during the transition period.","author":[{"family":"Trevisi","given":"E"},{"family":"Bertoni","given":"G"}],"citation-key":"Trevisi2008","ISBN":"978-1-60456-164-7","issue":"December","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"number-of-pages":"22-37","title":"Attenuation with acetylsalicylate treatments of inflammatory conditions in periparturient dairy cows","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Tucker1992a","abstract":"Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of a low dietary cation-anion balance (DCAB) in preventing milk fever and udder edema in dry cows consuming a high-Ca diet and to evaluate the effect of this diet on calves delivered by these cows. Seventy primiparous or multiparous cows and 50 pregnant heifers were offered alfalfa hay-based diets beginning 4 wk before their projected calving date. Diets contained 1.6% Ca and a DCAB of -3 or +9 mEq/100 g of diet DM. Blood and urine samples were collected weekly from 3 wk prepartum until 3 wk postpartum. Blood samples were collected from calves at parturition and weekly thereafter for 3 wk. Feeding a low vs high DCAB in a high-Ca diet for 3 wk prepartum did not reduce the incidence of milk fever; this lack of response may have been attributable to the relatively low DCAB of each diet and the small difference in DCAB between the two diets. Udder edema seemed to regress more rapidly postpartum for cows that had consumed the low DCAB during the dry period. Test diets fed to prepartum cows did not affect systemic acid-base status or plasma mineral content of their calves, although plasma Ca was somewhat lower for calves from cows consuming a low DCAB and was higher for calves from primigravid cows. Correlations of plasma mineral concentration of the cows with those of their calves were highest for plasma Ca (r = .75; P less than .001). We conclude that the prophylactic effects on the occurrence of milk fever of feeding a low DCAB during the dry period may be absent when diets contain greater than 1.6% Ca and DCAB is greater than or equal to -3. The cation-anion balance of the diet consumed by dry cows did not affect the acid-based status or plasma mineral content of their calves.","author":[{"family":"Tucker","given":"W B"},{"family":"Hogue","given":"J F"},{"family":"Adams","given":"G D"},{"family":"Aslam","given":"M"},{"family":"Shin","given":"I S"},{"family":"Morgan","given":"G"}],"citation-key":"Tucker1992a","container-title":"Journal of animal science","ISSN":"0021-8812","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992",4]]},"page":"1238-50","PMID":"1582954","title":"Influence of dietary cation-anion balance during the dry period on the occurrence of parturient paresis in cows fed excess calcium.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1582954","volume":"70"},

In experiment 1, stall width (112 or 132cm) and stall length (229 and 274cm from curb to wall) were compared in a 2×2 factorial arrangement of stall treatments using 15 individually housed, non-lactating animals. Cows showed no clear preference for stall size as measured by lying time. When animals had no choice between stalls, average lying time was higher in the wide stalls than in the narrow stalls (10.8 vs. 9.6±0.3h/24h). Both length and width affected time spent standing with only the front hooves in the stall; total stall area is best explained by the variation associated with this behavior. In experiment 2, 27 lactating dairy cattle were alternately housed with access to stalls of 106, 116, or 126cm in width using a cross-over design with exposure to each treatment lasting 3 wk. Animals spent an additional 42min/24h lying in stalls measuring 126cm in width compared with stalls with only 106cm between partitions. Free-stall width influenced the time spent standing with the front 2 hooves in the stall; animals averaged 58min/24h in the widest stalls and 85min/24h in the narrowest stalls. The amount of time spent standing with all 4 hooves in the stall tended to be longer in wider stalls, and these stalls were also most likely to become soiled with feces. Stall width did not affect the number of lying events or milk production. In conclusion, animals spent more time lying down, and less time was spent standing with only the front hooves in larger stalls, but larger stalls were also more likely to become soiled.","author":[{"family":"Tucker","given":"C.B."},{"family":"Weary","given":"D.M."},{"family":"Fraser","given":"D."}],"citation-key":"Tucker2004","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(04)73271-3","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"page":"1208-1216","PMID":"15290969","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Free-Stall Dimensions: Effects on Preference and Stall Usage","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030204732713","volume":"87"},
  {"id":"Tucker2005","abstract":"Three experiments examined how the presence of a neck rail at different heights and locations influenced dairy cattle behavior and stall cleanliness. Experiment 1 compared 4 levels of neck-rail height (102, 114, and 127 cm and no neck rail; presented at 160 or 180 cm from the curb) in a preference test. Cows (n = 10) showed no consistent preference based on neck-rail height, regardless of the horizontal position of the neck rail. When cows were restricted to each treatment in turn, however, time spent standing fully (with all 4 hooves) in the stall was least in the stall with the lowest neck rail (mean, 22 min/24 h) and was greatest in the stall with no neck rail (mean, 83 min/24 h). A second experiment examined the effect of a neck rail placed at 3 distances from the curb (140, 175, and 233 cm) when height was held constant (131 cm; n = 12). Time spent standing fully in the stall was least when the neck rail was close to the curb (140 cm; mean, 11 min/24 h) and was greatest when the neck rail was furthest from the curb (233 cm; mean, 86 min/24 h). When the neck rail was far from the curb, the cows were more likely to soil the stall by defecating while standing fully in the stall. Experiment 3 compared soiling of the stall by 14 cows with and without a neck rail at a height of 124.5 cm. When the neck rail was removed, cows were more than twice as likely to soil the stall by defecating while standing fully in the stall compared with when the neck rail was present (1.3 vs. 0.5 defecations/24 h). Thus, restrictive neck-rail placement prevents cows from standing in stall, but helps keep stalls clean. Access to more comfortable flooring surfaces outside the stall may help mitigate the negative effects of restrictive neck rails.","author":[{"family":"Tucker","given":"C.B."},{"family":"Weary","given":"D.M."},{"family":"Fraser","given":"D."}],"citation-key":"Tucker2005","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)72952-0","ISBN":"0022-0302, 0022-0302","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"page":"2730-2737","PMID":"16027186","title":"Influence of Neck-Rail Placement on Free-Stall Preference, Use, and Cleanliness","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030205729520","volume":"88"},
  {"id":"Tucker2006","abstract":"We examined how the presence of a brisket board influenced cow preference, stall use, and position within the stall. When given a choice between stalls with or without a brisket board, 15 nonlactating cows spent 68% of their time lying in the stalls without a brisket board, indicating that they preferred this option. When 13 cows had access to either stalls with a brisket board or ones without, they spent, on average, 1.2 h/d more time lying down in stalls without a brisket board. Resting cows positioned themselves relatively forward in the stalls in 98+or-5% (mean+or-SE) of lying bouts when the brisket board was absent, compared with 67+or-5% of bouts when the board was present. Longer cows were more likely than shorter cows to move forward in the stalls without a brisket board. Cows also had longer lying bouts in stalls without the brisket board (absent: 1.7+or-0.08; present: 1.5+or-0.08 h/bout). Although it seems likely that the brisket board helps keep stalls clean by positioning cows closer to the curb, our results indicate that brisket boards also make stalls less comfortable for cows.

Like any other building, they have to be mechanically air-conditioned to achieve the required thermal comfort for worshippers especially in harsh climatic regions. This paper describes the physical and operating characteristics typical for the intermittently occupied mosques as well as the results of the thermal optimization of a medium size mosque in the two hot-dry and hot-humid Saudi Arabian cities of Riyadh and Jeddah. The analysis utilizes a direct search optimization technique that is coupled to an hourly energy simulation program. Based on that, design guidelines are presented for the optimum thermal performance of mosques in these two cities in addition to other design and operating factors that need to be considered for mosques in general. © 2009 The Author(s).","author":[{"literal":"宗成庆"}],"citation-key":"Unknown","page":"7-8","title":"No Title统计自然语言处理（第二版）","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"Urrutia2019","abstract":"<h2>ABSTRACT</h2><p>Acetate is a major source of energy and substrate for milk fat synthesis in the dairy cow. We recently reported a linear increase in milk fat yield and greater than a 30% net apparent transfer of acetate to milk fat with ruminal infusion of neutralized acetate. Additionally, ruminal acetate infusion linearly increases plasma β-hydroxybutyrate. The objective of the current study was to investigate the ability of acetate and butyrate fed in a diet to increase milk fat synthesis. Twelve multiparous lactating Holstein cows were randomly assigned to treatments in a 3 × 3 Latin square design with 14-d periods that included a 7-d washout followed by 7 d of treatment. Cows were fed ad libitum a basal diet with a low risk for biohydrogenation-induced milk fat depression, and treatments were mixed into the basal diet. Treatments were 3.2% NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (control), 2.9% sodium acetate, and 2.5% calcium butyrate (carbon equivalent to acetate treatment) as a percent of diet dry matter. Feeding sodium acetate increased dry matter intake by 2.7 kg, had no effect on milk yield, and increased milk fat yield by 90 g/d and concentration by 0.2 percentage units, compared with control. Calcium butyrate decreased dry matter intake by 2.6 kg/d, milk yield by 1.65 kg/d, and milk fat yield by 60 g/d, compared with control. Sodium acetate increased concentration and yield of 16 carbon mixed source fatty acids (FA) and myristic acid, while decreasing the concentration of preformed FA, compared with control. Calcium butyrate had no effect on concentration of milk FA by source, but increased concentration of <i>trans</i>-10 C18:1 in milk by 18%, indicating a shift in rumen biohydrogenation pathways. Our data demonstrate that milk fat yield and concentration can be increased by feeding sodium acetate at 2.9% of diet dry matter, but not by feeding calcium butyrate at an equivalent carbon mass.</p>","author":[{"family":"Urrutia","given":"N."},{"family":"Bomberger","given":"R."},{"family":"Matamoros","given":"C."},{"family":"Harvatine","given":"K.J."}],"citation-key":"Urrutia2019","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2018-16024","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"5172-5181","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Effect of dietary supplementation of sodium acetate and calcium butyrate on milk fat synthesis in lactating dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030219303455","volume":"102"},

Diets were fed for 1-wk periods to eight nonlactating Holsteins assigned to two replicated 4 x 4 Latin squares. Daily DMI increased as time of access to the diet increased up to d 5; mean DMI over d 5 to 7 was reduced by dietary anionic salts. Diets containing anionic salts induced a mild metabolic acidosis that was completely compensated by nonrespiratory mechanisms (decreased blood bicarbonate and base excess; pCO2 and pH values were unaffected). Urinary pH values and bicarbonate excretion were reduced, and urinary NH4+ and titratable acidity excretion were increased, for cows fed diets containing anionic salts. Strong ion difference in urine was decreased by dietary anionic salts because of the relatively greater excretions of Cl- and S2- versus Na+ and K+ by cows fed these diets. Dietary anionic salts decreased mean ruminal pH by 0.12 units, possibly because of the reduced strong ion difference of ruminal fluid. Dietary anionic salts increased mean ruminal NH3 concentration by 2.2 mM, probably because of the higher nonprotein N content of these diets. The strong negative relationship (r2 = 0.95) between urinary pH and net acid excretion by cows fed the diets containing anionic salts suggested that urinary pH measurement might be a useful tool to assess the degree of metabolic acidosis that was imposed by dietary anionic salts.","author":[{"family":"Vagnoni","given":"D B"},{"family":"Oetzel","given":"G R"}],"citation-key":"Vagnoni1998","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(98)75732-7","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",6]]},"page":"1643-52","PMID":"9684172","title":"Effects of dietary cation-anion difference on the acid-base status of dry cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9684172","volume":"81"},

  {"id":"VanAmburgh2019","abstract":"To optimize first lactation and lifetime milk yield, growth benchmarks were established to help meet the appropriate growth objectives of breeding weight and age at an economically viable time and to achieve the optimum body size and composition at first calving. These guidelines provide a framework that helps to minimize overfeeding and, thus, potential overconditioning of heifers, which can lead to postpartum metabolic issues and reduced milk yield. Concerns still exist that mammary development is impaired when body weight gain exceeds a certain threshold, which would negatively affects milk yield. The objective of this review was to integrate concepts of nutrient requirements, body growth and composition, mammary development, and milk yield to provide a systems-based perspective on first-lactation milk differences that have been associated with mammary development. Work in the early 1980s described the effect of high energy intake on mammary development and the relationship with circulating growth hormone linked the relationship between prepubertal growth, mammary development, and future milk yield. The primary outcome of that research was to provide an intuitive mechanism to explain why rapid growth during the prepubertal phase resulted in reduced milk yield. The observation of reduced mammary development could be repeated in almost every experiment, leading to the conclusion that high energy intake and increased average daily gain reduced mammary development through altered hormone status or some signaling processes. However, further work that looked at mammary development over the entire prepubertal growth phase recognized that mammary development was not reduced by high energy intake, and instead accumulated at a constant rate; thus, overall mammary parenchymal growth was a function of the time to reach puberty and the associated signals to change from allometric mammary growth. The mammary gland, similar to most reproductive organs, grows in proportion to the size of the body and not in proportion to nutrient intake during the postweaning, prepubertal phase. First-lactation milk yield, mammary development, and body composition will be further discussed in the context of mechanisms and opportunities.","author":[{"family":"Van Amburgh","given":"M.

In the latter, the net energy for maintenance was assumed to be 70 kcal/kg a/~ metabolic body weight. Prediction of energy in milk and energy balance agreed well with the results of energy balance trials with dairy cows fed on winter rations. For fresh grass a discrepancy was found which is not yet explainable, but further research on this subject is in progress.

  {"id":"vaneetvelde2017","abstract":"Contents As heifer rearing is a costly investment, dairy farmers have been stimulated to maximize early growth of their calves, mainly by enhanced liquid feeding. However, the long-term effects of this “accelerated growth” are largely unknown. Studies recently performed at Ghent University indicate that in dairy cattle, certain maternal factors (such as young age and high milk yield) and environmental factors (such as high ambient temperatures) create a suboptimal environment for the developing foetus, altering the phenotype of the newborn calf. According to the “thrifty phenotype hypothesis,” these metabolic alterations prepare the newborn for similar (“matching”) conditions after birth, enhancing its survival during periods of limited feeding. Yet, when an abundance of nutrients is available in post-natal life (e.g., during periods of enhanced feeding), the “mismatch” between pre- and post-natal environment results in an early catch-up growth, with potential negative consequences. The aim of the article was to discuss this mismatch between pre- and post-natal environment in dairy calves. Previous studies, especially in human medicine, have shown catch-up growth to be associated with obesity, fertility problems, metabolic diseases and a reduced lifespan. Hence, we hypothesize that, by applying programs of accelerated growth, our current management system accentuates the mismatch between the pre- and post-natal environment in dairy calves. We can conclude that, although more research is necessary, the current findings point towards a more individual approach when rearing dairy heifers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Eetvelde","given":"M"},{"family":"Opsomer","given":"G"}],"citation-key":"vaneetvelde2017","container-title":"Reproduction in Domestic Animals","DOI":"10.1111/rda.13019","ISSN":"1439-0531","issue":"S3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"30-36","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Innovative look at dairy heifer rearing: Effect of prenatal and post-natal environment on later performance","title-short":"Innovative look at dairy heifer rearing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rda.13019","volume":"52"},

  {"id":"Vanhatalo2009","abstract":"This study investigated the effects of plant species (red clover vs. timothy-meadow fescue) and forage maturity at primary harvest (early vs. late cut silage) on rumen fermentation, nutrient digestion, and nitrogen metabolism including omasal canal AA flow and plasma AA concentration in lactating cows. Five dairy cows equipped with rumen cannulas were used in a study designed as a 5 x 5 Latin square with 21-d periods. The diets consisted of early-cut and late-cut grass and red clover silage, respectively, and a mixture of late-cut grass and early-cut red clover silages given ad libitum with 9 kg/d of a standard concentrate. Grass silage dry matter intake tended to decrease but that of red clover silages tended to increase with advancing maturity. Milk yields were unchanged among treatments, milk protein and fat concentrations being lower for red clover than for grass silage diets. Rumen fluid pH was unchanged but volatile fatty acid and ammonia concentrations were higher for red clover than for grass silage diets. Intake of N, and omasal canal flows of total nonammonia N (NAN), microbial NAN, and dietary NAN were higher for red clover than for grass silage diets but were not affected by forage maturity. However, microbial NAN flow and amount of N excreted in the feces decreased with advancing maturity for grass diets but increased for red clover diets. Apparent ruminal N degradability of the diets was unchanged, but true ruminal N degradability decreased and efficiency of microbial synthesis increased with red clover diets compared with grass silage diets. Omasal canal flows of AA, except those for Met and Cys, were on average 20% higher for red clover than grass silage diets. Omasal canal digesta concentrations of Leu, Phe, branched-chain, and essential AA were higher but those of Met lower for red clover than for grass silage diets. Plasma AA concentrations, except for His (unchanged) and Met (lower), were higher for red clover than for grass diets. However, none of these AA-related variables were affected by forage maturity. Total digestibility of N and excretion of N in the urine were higher for red clover than for grass diets and decreased with advancing maturity. It was concluded that despite the higher total AA supply of cows fed red clover versus grass silage diets, further milk production responses on red clover diets were compromised by an inadequate supply of Met as evidenced by lower Met concentration in the AA profile of omasal digesta and plasma.","author":[{"family":"Vanhatalo","given":"A."},{"family":"Kuoppala","given":"K."},{"family":"Ahvenjärvi","given":"S."},{"family":"Rinne","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"Vanhatalo2009","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2009-2249","ISBN":"1525-3198 (Electronic)\\r0022-0302 (Linking)","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"page":"5620-5633","PMID":"19841222","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effects of feeding grass or red clover silage cut at two maturity stages in dairy cows. 1.

  {"id":"vanholder2015","abstract":"© 2015 American Dairy Science Association.Ketosis is associated with many transition cow diseases and the subclinical form has been found to be a common condition in high-producing dairy cows. The objectives of this field study in the Netherlands were (1) to determine risk factors for subclinical ketosis [SCK; 1.2-2.9. mmol of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA)/L of serum] and clinical ketosis (CK: ≥3.0. mmol of BHBA/L of serum) at 7 to 14 d in milk and (2) to assess the association of SCK and CK with production parameters at the first dairy herd improvement (DHI) testing. Twenty-three dairies were enrolled by a local veterinary practice from 2009 to 2010, and 1,715 cows were screened for ketosis by measuring serum BHBA concentrations at 7 to 14 d in milk. Overall, 47.2% of cows had SCK and 11.6% had CK. Mixed generalized logit models with a random effect of herd were used to evaluate cow level factors associated with SCK and CK. The associations of SCK and CK with milk production parameters were tested using mixed linear models with a random effect of herd. Cows at a moderate (3.25-3.75) or fat (≥4) body condition score before calving were more likely to develop SCK and CK than thin (body condition score ≤ 3.0) cows. The risk for developing SCK was higher in parity 2 and older cows compared with heifers, whereas for CK only, parity ≥3 cows had a higher risk. The quarter of the year in which a cow calved was associated with the risk for SCK and CK. For SCK quarter 1 (January-March) and quarter 2 (April-June), and for CK quarter 1, quarter 2, and quarter 3 (July-September) all increased the risk of development of the condition compared with quarter 4 (October-December). An increased yield of colostrum at first milking was associated with increasing risk for SCK and CK. Prolonged previous lactation length and dry period length were both associated with increased odds for SCK and CK. Subclinical ketosis and CK were associated with a higher milk yield, a higher milk fat percentage, and a lower milk protein percentage at first DHI test day. Overall the study reinforces previous findings that the major risk factors for both SCK and CK are increasing parity, overconditioning of animals prepartum, season of calving, and dry period length. In addition, previous lactation length and liters of colostrum have been identified as additional risk factors for the development of ketosis.","author":[{"family":"Vanholder","given":"T."},{"family":"Papen","given":"J."},{"family":"Bemers","given":"R."},{"family":"Vertenten","given":"G."},{"family":"Berge","given":"A.

The objectives of this study were to compare the effects of a glucogenic or a lipogenic diet on liver triacylglycerides (TAG), metabolites, and metabolic hormones in dairy cows in early lactation and to relate metabolite concentrations to the determined energy retention in body mass (ER). Sixteen dairy cows were fed either a lipogenic or glucogenic diet from wk 3 prepartum to wk 9 postpartum (pp) and were housed in climate respiration chambers from wk 2 to 9 pp. Diets were isocaloric (net energy basis). Postpartum, cows fed a lipogenic diet tended to have higher nonesterified fatty acid concentration (NEFA; 0.46 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.37 +/- 0.04 mmol/L) and lower insulin concentration (4.0 +/- 0.5 vs. 5.5 +/- 0.6 microIU/mL). No difference was found in plasma glucose, beta-hydroxybutyrate, insulin-like growth factor-I, and thyroid hormones. Liver TAG was equal between both diets in wk -2 and 2 pp. In wk 4 pp cows fed the glucogenic diet had numerically lower TAG levels, although there was no significant dietary effect. Negative relationships were detected between ER and milk fat and between ER and NEFA. A positive relationship was detected between ER and insulin concentration. Overall, results suggest that insulin plays a regulating role in altering energy partitioning between milk and body tissue. Feeding lactating dairy cows a glucogenic diet decreased mobilization of body fat compared with a lipogenic diet. The relative abundance of lipogenic nutrients, when feeding a more lipogenic diet, is related to more secretion of lipogenic nutrients in milk, lower plasma insulin, and higher plasma NEFA concentration.","author":[{"family":"Knegsel","given":"a T M","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Brand","given":"H","non-dropping-particle":"van den"},{"family":"Graat","given":"E a M"},{"family":"Dijkstra","given":"J"},{"family":"Jorritsma","given":"R"},{"family":"Decuypere","given":"E"},{"family":"Tamminga","given":"S"},{"family":"Kemp","given":"B"}],"citation-key":"VanKnegsel2007","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(07)71633-8","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",3]]},"page":"1477-85","PMID":"17297121","title":"Dietary energy source in dairy cows in early lactation: metabolites and metabolic hormones.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17297121","volume":"90"},
  {"id":"VanKnegsel2007a","abstract":"This paper summarizes three recent studies by the same authors with the objective to study the effect of dietary energy source on the energy balance (EB) and risk for metabolic and reproductive disorders in dairy cows in early lactation. The first study, a literature survey, illustrated that feeding extra glucogenic nutrients relative to lipogenic nutrients, decreased milk fat and seems to decrease plasma non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) concentration. However studies are scarce and mostly confound the effect of energy source with level of energy intake, compromising eventual effects on EB and fertility. Therefore, in the second study, 16 dairy cows were either fed a glucogenic or a lipogenic diet (isocaloric) and EB was determined in climate-controlled respiration chambers from week 2 until 9 of lactation. Glucogenic diet decreased milk fat yield and milk energy and tended to decrease body fat mobilization compared with lipogenic diet. The objective of the third study was to study the effect of dietary energy source on EB, metabolites and reproduction variables. Dairy cows (n=111) were fed glucogenic, lipogenic or mixed diet from week 3 until week 9 relative to calving. Multiparous cows fed glucogenic diet had lower milk fat yield, higher calculated EB, and lower plasma NEFA, BHBA and liver triacylglyceride concentration and tended to have fewer days to first postpartum ovulation. In conclusion, increasing the glucogenic nutrient availability improved the EB and had potential to reduce the risk for metabolic disorders and to improve reproductive performance in dairy cows.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",2,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Knegsel","given":"a T M","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Brand","given":"H","non-dropping-particle":"van den"},{"family":"Dijkstra","given":"J"},{"family":"Kemp","given":"B"}],"citation-key":"VanKnegsel2007a","container-title":"Theriogenology","DOI":"10.1016/j.theriogenology.2007.04.043","ISSN":"0093-691X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",9,1]]},"page":"S274-80","PMID":"17537496","title":"Effects of dietary energy source on energy balance, metabolites and reproduction variables in dairy cows in early lactation.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17537496","volume":"68 Suppl 1"},

  {"id":"VanRaden2008","abstract":"Efficient methods for processing genomic data were developed to increase reliability of estimated breeding values and to estimate thousands of marker effects simultaneously. Algorithms were derived and computer programs tested with simulated data for 2,967 bulls and 50,000 markers distributed randomly across 30 chromosomes. Estimation of genomic inbreeding coefficients required accurate estimates of allele frequencies in the base population. Linear model predictions of breeding values were computed by 3 equivalent methods: 1) iteration for individual allele effects followed by summation across loci to obtain estimated breeding values, 2) selection index including a genomic relationship matrix, and 3) mixed model equations including the inverse of genomic relationships. A blend of first- and second-order Jacobi iteration using 2 separate relaxation factors converged well for allele frequencies and effects. Reliability of predicted net merit for young bulls was 63% compared with 32% using the traditional relationship matrix. Nonlinear predictions were also computed using iteration on data and nonlinear regression on marker deviations; an additional (about 3%) gain in reliability for young bulls increased average reliability to 66%. Computing times increased linearly with number of genotypes. Estimation of allele frequencies required 2 processor days, and genomic predictions required <1 d per trait, and traits were processed in parallel. Information from genotyping was equivalent to about 20 daughters with phenotypic records. Actual gains may differ because the simulation did not account for linkage disequilibrium in the base population or selection in subsequent generations.","author":[{"family":"VanRaden","given":"P M"}],"citation-key":"VanRaden2008","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2007-0980","ISBN":"1525-3198 (Electronic)","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"page":"4414-4423","PMID":"18946147","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Efficient Methods to Compute Genomic Predictions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2007-0980","volume":"91"},

We studied lactations from 634 primiparous and 1,086 multiparous Israeli Holstein dairy cows originating from 7 commercial dairy farms. Generalized mixed models with a random herd effect were used to quantify the effects of BW and BCS variables in early lactation on events of elevated SCC. Data were analyzed using 2 different approaches. In the first approach, only first events in a lactation were taken into account, whereas in the second approach, all events in a lactation were analyzed and repeated events from the same cow were accounted for. Although no associations were found between the different BW and BCS variables and first events of elevated SCC, associations were present between these variables and events of elevated SCC when all events were analyzed. The cumulative incidence of a lactation with multiple events of SCC >250,000 cells/mL was 8.8 and 27.7% for primiparous and multiparous cows, respectively. The odds of an event of SCC >250,000 cells/mL were 25% greater for cows belonging to the upper quartile in relative BW loss from calving to nadir BW (loss >12.3, 15.0, and 15.7% for first-, second-, and third-parity and greater cows, respectively) compared with cows losing less relative BW. Odds of an event were 44% greater for cows with ketosis when compared with cows without. The cumulative incidence of a lactation with multiple events of SCC >400,000 cells/mL was 4.1 and 14.3% for primiparous and multiparous cows, respectively. The odds of an event of SCC >400,000 cells/ mL were 43% greater for cows belonging to the upper quartile in relative BW loss from calving to nadir BW compared with cows losing less relative BW. Odds of an event were 33% greater for cows with ketosis when compared with cows without. Assuming that extreme BW loss and ketosis in early lactation indicate a more severe negative energy balance, our findings support the hypothesis that greater negative energy balance in early lactation predisposes dairy cows to udder inflammation. Considering the fact that many of the events were recurring, we stress the importance of including all events in the analysis and postulate the possibility of long-term detrimental effects of negative energy balance on udder health.","author":[{"family":"Van Straten","given":"M"},{"family":"Friger","given":"M"},{"family":"Shpigel","given":"N Y"}],"citation-key":"vanstratenEventsElevatedSomatic","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2009-2204","title":"Events of elevated somatic cell counts in high-producing dairy cows are associated with daily body weight loss in early lactation","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"VanWerven2018","abstract":"Udder cleft dermatitis (UCD) is a skin lesion in dairy cows affecting the anterior parts of the udder, with the lesions often needing a long time to heal. The lesions can be characterized as mild or severe. The etiology of UCD is not fully understood and studies on the effectiveness of topical treatments have not been published. The objective of this study, therefore, was to conduct a randomized clinical trial to investigate the effectiveness of 2 different topical treatments, one for mild and one for severe UCD lesions, compared with untreated control groups. The treatment and control groups were randomized within herd for mild and severe UCD. The treatments were applied for a maximum period of 12 wk on 8 Dutch dairy farms. Mild UCD lesions were treated once a d 3 times a week on fixed days with a non-sting barrier film. Severe UCD lesions were first stratified into class A (lesion length <5 cm) or class B (lesion length ≥5 cm) and then randomly allocated to treatment or control groups within herd. Both severe lesion classes were treated once per day every day with an enzyme alginogel. Every week, the lesions of affected animals were inspected and photographed by the investigator. These photographs were reviewed weekly by an external wound expert who classified the lesions as mild, severe class A, severe class B, or healed. Based on this classification, the investigator judged weekly whether the lesions had improved compared with their classification of the previous week. For mild UCD lesions, improvement was defined as occurring when lesions were healed. For severe UCD lesions, improvement was defined as a transition from class B to class A, transition from any severe UCD lesion (class A or B) to a mild UCD lesion, or when the lesion was defined as healed. Data were analyzed using a discrete time survival analysis with time to first improvement as dependent variable. In total, data from 214 animals were analyzed to estimate the effectiveness of treatment. Results showed that treatment of mild UCD lesions had no influence on improvement compared with untreated lesions. Treated severe lesions, however, showed 3.4 times more improvement compared with the untreated controls. Improvement varied between herds, and cows with a parity of 5 or higher showed significantly less improvement than first parity animals. Early identification of severe UCD lesions followed by prompt treatment with an enzyme alginogel supports the healing process.","author":[{"family":"Werven","given":"T.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Wilmink","given":"J."},{"family":"Sietsma","given":"S."},{"family":"Broek","given":"J.","non-dropping-particle":"van den"},{"family":"Nielen","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"VanWerven2018","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2017-13778","ISSN":"15253198","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"8259-8268","PMID":"30126601","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"A randomized clinical trial of topical treatments for mild and severe udder cleft dermatitis in Dutch dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-13778","volume":"101"},

  {"id":"VanZijderveld2011a","abstract":"Feeding nitrate to dairy cows may lower ruminal methane production by competing for reducing equivalents with methanogenesis. Twenty lactating Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (33.2±6.0 kg of milk/d; 104±58 d in milk at the start of the experiment) were fed a total mixed ration (corn silage-based; forage to concentrate ratio 66:34), containing either a dietary urea or a dietary nitrate source [21 g of nitrate/kg of dry matter (DM)] during 4 successive 24-d periods, to assess the methane-mitigating potential of dietary nitrate and its persistency. The study was conducted as paired comparisons in a randomized design with repeated measurements. Cows were blocked by parity, lactation stage, and milk production at the start of the experiment. A 4-wk adaptation period allowed the rumen microbes to adapt to dietary urea and nitrate. Diets were isoenergetic and isonitrogenous. Methane production, energy balance, and diet digestibility were measured in open-circuit indirect calorimetry chambers. Cows were limit-fed during measurements. Nitrate persistently decreased methane production by 16%, whether expressed in grams per day, grams per kilogram of dry matter intake (DMI), or as percentage of gross energy intake, which was sustained for the full experimental period (mean 368 vs. 310±12.5 g/d; 19.4 vs. 16.2±0.47 g/kg of DMI; 5.9 vs.4.9±0.15% of gross energy intake for urea vs. nitrate, respectively). This decrease was smaller than the stoichiometrical methane mitigation potential of nitrate (full potential=28% methane reduction). The decreased energy loss from methane resulted in an improved conversion of dietary energy intake into metabolizable energy (57.3 vs. 58.6±0.70%, urea vs. nitrate, respectively). Despite this, milk energy output or energy retention was not affected by dietary nitrate. Nitrate did not affect milk yield or apparent digestibility of crude fat, neutral detergent fiber, and starch. Milk protein content (3.21 vs. 3.05±0.058%, urea vs. nitrate respectively) but not protein yield was lower for dietary nitrate. Hydrogen production between morning and afternoon milking was measured during the last experimental period. Cows fed nitrate emitted more hydrogen. Cows fed nitrate displayed higher blood methemoglobin levels (0.5 vs. 4.0±1.07% of hemoglobin, urea vs. nitrate respectively) and lower hemoglobin levels (7.1 vs. 6.3±0.11 mmol/L, urea vs. nitrate respectively).

Ten Red Danish cows in mid-lactation (203 ± 31 d in milk; average ± SD) were chosen from these 2 groups for intensive sampling. The treated group drank water with 4 ppm of ECW (29 mg/L of chlorate of Neuthox, Danish Clean Water A/S, Sønderborg, Denmark). The treatment lasted 60 consecutive days, with milk and water sampling on d 0, 30, and 60. Additionally, milk samples from both the control group and treated group were taken on d 90 to assess if any carry-over effect was present. Interactions between period and milk yield and somatic cell for the full group and period and milk fat content and milk urea nitrogen in the selected animals occurred. Milk yield was not significantly affected by treatments. Milk fat, milk fatty acid profile, chlorate, perchlorate, and iodine contents were not significantly different between treatments. Milk urea increased, whereas β-hydroxybutyrate and somatic cell count decreased significantly in the treated groups. Results showed that at a dosing of 4 ppm of ECW, both chlorate and perchlorate concentrations in milk (<0.002 mg/kg) were low, and no deleterious effects on milk production or milk chemical composition were observed. These data can be of use when assessing the effects of ECW on milk and milk powder chlorate and perchlorate levels and provide a context for assessing the potential for influencing human health under the conditions prevailing on a commercial dairy farm.","author":[{"family":"Vargas-Bello-Pérez","given":"Einar"},{"family":"Dhakal","given":"Rajan"},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Mette O."},{"family":"Ahrné","given":"Lilia"},{"family":"Hansen","given":"Hanne H."}],"citation-key":"Vargas-Bello-Perez2020","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2019-17510","ISSN":"15253198","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"1208-1214","PMID":"31837793","title":"Short communication: Effects of electrochemically activated drinking water on bovine milk production and composition, including chlorate, perchlorate, and fatty acid profile","type":"article-journal","volume":"103"},
  {"id":"Vargas-Rodriguez2014","abstract":"Chromium (Cr) feeding in early lactation increased milk production in some studies, but responses to dietary Cr during peak lactation have not been evaluated. Furthermore, interactions of essential amino acids (AA) and Cr have not been explored. Our objective was to evaluate responses to CrPr (KemTRACE chromium propionate 0.04%, Kemin Industries Inc., Des Moines, IA) and rumen-protected Lys (LysiPEARL, Kemin Industries Inc.) and Met (MetiPEARL, Kemin Industries Inc.) and their interaction in peak-lactation cows. Forty-eight individually fed Holstein cows (21 primiparous, 27 multiparous, 38±15d in milk) were stratified by calving date in 12 blocks and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments within block. Treatments were control, CrPr (8mg/d of Cr), RPLM (10g/d of Lys and 5g/d of Met, intestinally available), or CrPr plus RPLM. Treatments were premixed with ground corn and top-dressed at 200g/d for 35d. Diets consisted of corn silage, alfalfa hay, and concentrates, providing approximately 17% crude protein, 31% neutral detergent fiber, and 40% nonfiber carbohydrates. Dry matter intake (DMI) significantly increased with the inclusion of CrPr (22.2 vs. 20.8±0.67kg/d), and energy-corrected milk (ECM) yield tended to increase. In addition, CrPr increased milk protein yield and tended to increase DMI in primiparous cows but not in multiparous cows. A CrPr×week interaction was detected for milk lactose content, which was increased by CrPr during wk 1 only (4.99 vs. 4.88±0.036%). As a proportion of plasma AA, lysine increased and methionine tended to increase in response to RPLM, but the inclusion of RPLM decreased N efficiency (milk protein N:N intake). Digestible energy intake, gross energy digestibility, and energy balance were not affected by treatments. We observed no treatment effects on feed efficiency or changes in body weight or body condition score. In summary, feeding CrPr increased DMI and tended to increase ECM in cows fed for 5wk near peak lactation, with primiparous cows showing greater responses in DMI and milk protein yield than multiparous cows.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Vargas-Rodriguez","given":"C F"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"K"},{"family":"Titgemeyer","given":"E C"},{"family":"Mamedova","given":"L K"},{"family":"Griswold","given":"K E"},{"family":"Bradford","given":"B J"}],"citation-key":"Vargas-Rodriguez2014","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2013-7767","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6]]},"page":"3815-21","PMID":"24731641","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effects of supplemental chromium propionate and rumen-protected amino acids on productivity, diet digestibility, and energy balance of peak-lactation dairy cattle.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24731641","volume":"97"},

  {"id":"Vaughan2016","abstract":"Cross sucking by dairy calves occurs most commonly before weaning, but is of most concern in older animals where it has been claimed to cause mastitis and udder damage. Providing ad libitum milk allowance via a teat and gradual weaning reduces cross sucking, but low levels of this behavior still persist. Our aims were to understand why this behavior persists in some calves after weaning off milk and to examine whether individuals which are cross sucked postweaning are more likely to sustain teat injury or develop mastitis during their first lactation. Fifty-six female Holstein calves were housed in groups of 8 and fed milk, grain, and hay ad libitum from automated feeders. During weaning, milk allowance was gradually reduced according to grain intake. Cross sucking was recorded using overhead video cameras (5 observation periods of 72 h). The effects of weaning on cross sucking were examined; to examine whether cross sucking affected udder health, all incidences of damaged quarters or clinical and sub-clinical mastitis in the first lactation were recorded, as was milk production. The overall level of cross sucking after weaning, at 4 to 5 mo of age, was low and a small proportion of individuals accounted for the majority of events. The duration of cross sucking that occurred at 4 to 5 mo of age was correlated with the amount of cross sucking done before and immediately after weaning. After weaning, the calves that cross sucked did so on certain calves, with the most sucked calf within each pen accounting for 73.98% of all cross-sucking events. No relationship was found between cross sucking and being cross sucked in the period before weaning but a positive correlation was found by 4 to 5 mo of age. The majority of calves reduced or ceased cross sucking after weaning. Individuals still observed to be cross sucking by 4 to 5 mo of age had formed pairs with other cross-sucking individuals and cross-sucking events occurred almost exclusively between these pairs. Cows that were cross sucked as heifers were no more likely to develop mastitis or have higher somatic cell count in their first lactation than those which were not involved in cross sucking. Cross sucking typically begins before weaning, but the formation of lasting pairs of reciprocal cross-sucking partners after weaning may be responsible for this behavior persisting in group housed dairy calves after weaning off milk. Low levels of cross sucking did not appear to have a negative effect on udder health.","author":[{"family":"Vaughan","given":"Alison"},{"family":"Miguel-Pacheco","given":"Giuliana G."},{"family":"Marie de Passillé","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Rushen","given":"Jeffrey"}],"citation-key":"Vaughan2016","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2015-9504","ISSN":"15253198","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"5596-5603","PMID":"27085413","title":"Reciprocated cross sucking between dairy calves after weaning off milk does not appear to negatively affect udder health or production","type":"article-journal","volume":"99"},

The metabolizable energy and NEL contents of feeds seemed overestimated by the US system compared with results using the European systems, and the ratio of NEL to total digestible nutrients was almost constant, unlike the other systems. Estimating the NEL content of feeds for a level three times maintenance intake allowed satisfactory rationing for the production of 20 to 25 kg of fat-corrected milk/d. However, feed allowances seemed underestimated for higher milk production, especially with diets based on hay, probably because of the overestimation of feed NEL content, the underestimation of level of feeding, and the effects associated with feeding levels > 3 and high concentrate diets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Vermorel","given":"M"},{"family":"Coulon","given":"J B"}],"citation-key":"Vermorel1998a","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(98)75643-7","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",3]]},"page":"846-55","PMID":"9565890","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Comparison of the National Research Council energy system for lactating cows with four European systems.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9565890","volume":"81"},

Several common features emerged from comparative analysis of four imprinted domains in mice and humans: (a) Certain genes appear to be imprinted by secondary events, possibly indicating a lack of gene-specific imprinting marks; (b) some genes appear to resist silencing, predicting the presence of cis-elements that oppose domain-specific imprinting control; (c) the nature of the imprinting mark remains incompletely understood. In addition, common silencing mechanisms are employed by the various imprinting domains, including silencer elements that nucleate and propagate a silent chromatin state, insulator elements that prevent promoter-enhancer interactions when hypomethylated on one parental allele, and antisense RNAs that function in silencing the overlapping sense gene and more distantly located genes.

Twenty commercial farms were monitored over a period of 12 months.

A total of 2857 urine samples were taken from 1112 cows to examine the ketonuria from about 30 days prepartum to 100 postpartum. Wide variation was recorded in the quality of silages used in the preparation of diets. Approximately 80% of the urine samples analyzed had no detectable ketone bodies, 16% returned values indicative of slight SCK, and the remainder, 4%, showed symptoms of ketosis. Most of the cases of hyperkenuria were associated with the butyric acid content of the silage used (r (2) = 0.56; P < 0.05). As the metabolizable energy content of the feed was similar, no relationship was observed between the proportion of cows with SCK and the energy content of the feed.

This paper looks at the development of fully bio-based composites where agro-resources are valued as bio-based aggregates (hemp) and as binding materials (wheat). In a previous work, a feasibility study simultaneously investigated the processing and ratio of wheat straw required to ensure a gluing effect. In this paper, three kinds of hemp-straw composites are selected and compared with a hemp-polysaccharides composite. The gluing effect is analyzed chemically and via SEM. The developed composites were characterized multi-physically. They showed sufﬁciently high mechanical properties to be used as insulating materials. Furthermore, they showed good thermal performances with a low thermal conductivity (67.9–69.0 mW/(m·K) at 23 °C, dry).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Viel","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Collet","given":"Florence"},{"family":"Prétot","given":"Sylvie"},{"family":"Lanos","given":"Christophe"}],"citation-key":"viel2019","container-title":"Materials","container-title-short":"Materials","DOI":"10.3390/ma12081199","ISSN":"1996-1944","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,12]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"1199","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Hemp-Straw Composites: Gluing Study and Multi-Physical Characterizations","title-short":"Hemp-Straw Composites","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/12/8/1199","volume":"12"},

The concept of heritability and its definition as an estimable, dimensionless population parameter was introduced by Sewall Wright and Ronald Fisher nearly a century ago. Despite continuous misunderstandings and controversies over its use and application, heritability remains key to the response to selection in evolutionary biology and agriculture, and to the prediction of disease risk in medicine. Recent reports of substantial heritability for gene expression and new estimation methods using marker data highlight the relevance of heritability in the genomics era.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Visscher","given":"Peter M"},{"family":"Hill","given":"William G"},{"family":"Wray","given":"Naomi R"}],"citation-key":"Visscher2008","container-title":"Nature reviews.

Increasing beet pulp in the diet caused a linear decrease in dry matter intake (DMI). Time spent eating per day and per kilogram of DMI increased, and sorting against NDF tended to increase, with added beet pulp. Substituting beet pulp for corn caused a quadratic response in milk fat yield, with the highest yield for the 6% beet pulp treatment. A tendency was detected for a similar quadratic response in 3.5% fat-corrected milk yield. Lower plasma insulin concentration may have resulted in lower body condition gain for cows fed diets with higher beet pulp concentration.

Passage rates of potentially digestible NDF and of indigestible NDF were not affected by treatment. True ruminal digestibility of starch decreased with increasing beet pulp substitution. This was caused by a linear increase in starch passage rate, possibly because of increasing ruminal fill, and a linear decrease in digestion rate of starch in the rumen, possibly because of reduced amylolytic enzyme activity for lower-starch diets. Although true ruminal starch digestibility decreased when more beet pulp was fed, whole tract starch digestibility was not affected because of compensatory digestion of starch in the intestines. Due to more thorough digestion of fiber in diets containing more beet pulp, whole-tract digestibility of organic matter increased linearly, and intake of digestible organic matter was not affected. Partially replacing high-moisture corn with beet pulp in low-forage diets increased fiber digestibility without reducing whole-tract starch digestibility.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Voelker","given":"J","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Allen","given":"M S"}],"citation-key":"Voelker2003a","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(03)73960-5","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",11]]},"page":"3553-61","PMID":"14672185","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Pelleted beet pulp substituted for high-moisture corn: 2.

Thus, the establishment of new forms of therapy is still needed. Our objective was to examine the effect of the nonpathogenic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 on the prophylaxis and treatment of neonatal calf diarrhea in a hypothesis-generating study (study I) and a subsequent confirmatory clinical study (study II) under field conditions. Both trials were designed as consecutive, placebo-controlled, single-blind comparisons of 2 groups of animals. Immediately after birth, healthy calves were assigned to either the E. coli Nissle 1917 or the placebo group. The study medication was administered orally 1/d before the first feeding. The treatment was continued for the first 10 to 12 d of life. For each animal, the studies ended on d 20 to 22 of life. In both trials, the number of calves developing diarrhea was defined as the primary target criterion. A total of 335 newborn calves were included in the studies (study I: n = 172; study II: n = 163). Study I showed that the incidence of diarrhea was 65.2% under placebo and 26.5% under E. coli Nissle 1917. In study II, the corresponding figures were 63.0% under placebo and 12.2% under E. coli Nissle 1917. It can be concluded that the administration of viable E. coli bacteria, strain Nissle 1917, has a clear beneficial effect on the prophylaxis and treatment of neonatal calf diarrhea.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Buenau","given":"R.","non-dropping-particle":"von"},{"family":"Jaekel","given":"L."},{"family":"Schubotz","given":"E."},{"family":"Schwarz","given":"S."},{"family":"Stroff","given":"T."},{"family":"Krueger","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"vonbuenau2005","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)72690-4","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",1,1]]},"page":"317-323","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"<i>Escherichia coli</i> Strain Nissle 1917: Significant Reduction of Neonatal Calf Diarrhea","title-short":"<i>Escherichia coli</i> Strain Nissle 1917","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030205726904","volume":"88"},

  {"id":"Wallace2016","abstract":"Increasingly, feed additives for livestock, such as amino acids and vitamins, are being produced by Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli. The potential therefore exists for animals, consumers and workers to be exposed to possibly harmful amounts of endotoxin from these products. The aim of this review was to assess the extent of the risk from endotoxins in feed additives and to calculate how such risk can be assessed from the properties of the additive. Livestock are frequently exposed to a relatively high content of endotoxin in the diet: no additional hazard to livestock would be anticipated if the endotoxin concentration of the feed additive falls in the same range as feedstuffs. Consumer exposure will be unaffected by the consumption of food derived from animals receiving endotoxin-containing feed, because the small concentrations of endotoxin absorbed do not accumulate in edible tissues. In contrast, workers processing a dusty additive may be exposed to hazardous amounts of endotoxin even if the endotoxin concentration of the product is low. A calculation method is proposed to compare the potential risk to the worker, based on the dusting potential, the endotoxin concentration and technical guidance of the European Food Safety Authority, with national exposure limits.","author":[{"family":"Wallace","given":"R.

  {"id":"Wan2019","abstract":"OBJECTIVE To investigate whether diets differing in fat content alter the gut microbiota and faecal metabolomic profiles, and to determine their relationship with cardiometabolic risk factors in healthy adults whose diet is in a transition from a traditional low-fat diet to a diet high in fat and reduced in carbohydrate. METHODS In a 6-month randomised controlled-feeding trial, 217 healthy young adults (aged 18-35 years; body mass index <28 kg/m2; 52% women) who completed the whole trial were included. All the foods were provided during the intervention period. The three isocaloric diets were: a lower-fat diet (fat 20% energy), a moderate-fat diet (fat 30% energy) and a higher-fat diet (fat 40% energy). The effects of the dietary interventions on the gut microbiota, faecal metabolomics and plasma inflammatory factors were investigated. RESULTS The lower-fat diet was associated with increased α-diversity assessed by the Shannon index (p=0.03), increased abundance of Blautia (p=0.007) and Faecalibacterium (p=0.04), whereas the higher-fat diet was associated with increased Alistipes (p=0.04), Bacteroides (p<0.001) and decreased Faecalibacterium (p=0.04). The concentration of total short-chain fatty acids was significantly decreased in the higher-fat diet group in comparison with the other groups (p<0.001). The cometabolites p-cresol and indole, known to be associated with host metabolic disorders, were decreased in the lower-fat diet group. In addition, the higher-fat diet was associated with faecal enrichment in arachidonic acid and the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway as well as elevated plasma proinflammatory factors after the intervention. CONCLUSION Higher-fat consumption by healthy young adults whose diet is in a state of nutrition transition appeared to be associated with unfavourable changes in gut microbiota, faecal metabolomic profiles and plasma proinﬂammatory factors, which might confer adverse consequences for long-term health outcomes.

  {"id":"Wang2006","abstract":"The identification of genes that affect quantitative traits has been of great interest to geneticists for many decades, and many statistical methods have been developed to map quantitative trait loci (QTL). Most QTL mapping studies in experimental organisms use purely inbred lines, where the two homologous chromosomes in each individual are identical. As a result, many existing QTL mapping methods developed for experimental organisms are applicable only to genetic crosses between inbred lines. However, it may be difficult to obtain inbred lines for certain organisms, e.g., mosquitoes. Although statistical methods for QTL mapping in outbred populations, e.g., humans, can be applied for such crosses, these methods may not fully take advantage of the uniqueness of these crosses. For example, we can generally assume that the two grandparental lines are homozygous at the QTL of interest, but such information is not be utilized through methods developed for outbred populations. In addition, mating types and phases can be relatively easy to establish through the analysis of adjacent markers due to the large number of offspring that can be collected, substantially simplifying the computational need. In this article, motivated by a mosquito intercross experiment involving two selected lines that are not genetically homozygous across the genome, we develop statistical methods for QTL mapping for genetic crosses involving noninbred lines. In our procedure, we first infer parental mating types and use likelihood-based methods to infer phases in each parent on the basis of genotypes of offspring and one parent. A hidden Markov model is then employed to estimate the number of high-risk alleles at marker positions and putative QTL positions between markers in each offspring, and QTL mapping is finally conducted through the inferred QTL configuration across all offspring in all crosses. The performance of the proposed methods is assessed through simulation studies, and the usefulness of this method is demonstrated through its application to a mosquito data set.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Shuang"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Song"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Liangbiao"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Hongyu"}],"citation-key":"Wang2006","container-title":"Genetics","DOI":"10.1534/genetics.105.050419","ISSN":"0016-6731","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",4]]},"page":"2293-308","PMID":"16415368","title":"Mapping quantitative trait loci in noninbred mosquito crosses.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1456396&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","volume":"172"},

The degree of imprinting is often tissue-specific and/or developmental stage-specific, and may be altered in some diseases including cancer. Here we applied Illumina/Solexa sequencing of the transcriptomes of reciprocal F1 mouse neonatal brains and identified 26 genes with parent-of-origin dependent differential allelic expression. Allele-specific Pyrosequencing verified 17 of them, including three novel imprinted genes. The known and novel imprinted genes all are found in proximity to previously reported differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Ten genes known to be imprinted in placenta had sufficient expression levels to attain a read depth that provided statistical power to detect imprinting, and yet all were consistent with non-imprinting in our transcript count data for neonatal brain. Three closely linked and reciprocally imprinted gene pairs were also discovered, and their pattern of expression suggests transcriptional interference. Despite the coverage of more than 5000 genes, this scan only identified three novel imprinted refseq genes in neonatal brain, suggesting that this tissue is nearly exhaustively characterized. This approach has the potential to yield an complete catalog of imprinted genes after application to multiple tissues and developmental stages, shedding light on the mechanism, bioinformatic prediction, and evolution of imprinted genes and diseases associated with genomic imprinting.</p>","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Xu"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Qi"},{"family":"McGrath","given":"Sean D"},{"family":"Mardis","given":"Elaine R"},{"family":"Soloway","given":"Paul D"},{"family":"Clark","given":"Andrew G"}],"citation-key":"wang2008","container-title":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0003839","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"page":"e3839","publisher":"Public Library of Science","title":"Transcriptome-Wide Identification of Novel Imprinted Genes in Neonatal Mouse Brain","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003839","volume":"3"},

Eight periparturient Jersey cattle were randomly assigned to one of two treat- ments: control and treated. Control animals were fed a dry cow ration for 1 month prior to calving. The treated cows were fed the same ration supplemented with OmniGen-AF. Following calving, blood samples were taken and neutrophils were prepared after which RNA was extracted. Gene expression in neutrophils of treated versus control-fed animals was then assessed using bovine-total leukocyte (BOTL-5) arrays. Eighteen genes were differentially regulated in the experimental group and of these, twice as many were up-regulated as down-regulated. Patterns of changes indicated that the additive might alter neutrophil apoptosis, signaling and sensitivity. Two of the regulated genes [inter- leukin-1b converting enzyme (ICE) and interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R)] were investigated in more detail using quantitative reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). Each was found to be elevated by the feeding of experimental product. Increased expression of ICE indicates potential for enhanced neutrophil expression of interleukin-1b (IL-1b), a cytokine which plays roles in the inflammatory response and which stimulates adaptive immunity following innate immune activa- tion. Altered expression of IL-4R indicates potential for changes in neu- trophil apoptosis. The experiment identified mechanisms by which the additive altered neutrophil gene expression. While many nutrients sup- port the immune system, we have shown that a non-traditional nutri- tional approach may also have utility in modulating immune function.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Y.

  {"id":"Wang2013","abstract":"The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of non-protected and rumen-protected gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) supplementation on dry matter intake (DMI), energy balance, milk performance, and serum metabolites in transition cows. Forty cows were blocked based on previous milk production, parity, estimated calving date and body weight and were randomly assigned to one of four treatments and received either no GABA (control) or were supplemented with non-protected GABA (0.6. g/day) or rumen-protected GABA (0.6 and 1.2. g/day), respectively. The experiment lasted from week 2 before calving to week 4 after calving. Milk yield and milk composition were recorded weekly. Serum concentrations of GABA, neuropeptide Y, cholecystokinin, leptin and biochemical and antioxidative metabolites were analyzed weekly. In week 3 and 4 after calving, DMI was higher (P<0.05) in the cows fed 1.2. g/day rumen-protected GABA, compared with that of the control. In week 4 after calving, milk protein yield was higher in the cows fed 1.2. g/day rumen-protected GABA than that of the control cows. No differences were observed in the serum concentrations of GABA, neuropeptide Y and leptin among all the treatments, while non-esterified fatty acids and cholecystokinin concentrations decreased (P<0.01) in cows fed rumen-protected GABA on day 15 and 22 after calving, respectively. Serum total antioxidative capacity and concentrations of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase were higher (P<0.05) at several sampling points in cows fed rumen-protected GABA. In conclusion, supplementation of rumen-protected GABA at 1.2. g/day increased feed intake, improved milk protein yield, and decreased non-esterified fatty acids suggesting supplementation may be beneficial to postpartum dairy cows. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"D.

  {"id":"wang2021","abstract":"Monitoring, recording, and predicting livestock body weight (BW) allows for timely intervention in diets and health, greater efficiency in genetic selection, and identification of optimal times to market animals because animals that have already reached the point of slaughter represent a burden for the feedlot. There are currently two main approaches (direct and indirect) to measure the BW in livestock. Direct approaches include partial-weight or full-weight industrial scales placed in designated locations on large farms that measure passively or dynamically the weight of livestock. While these devices are very accurate, their acquisition, intended purpose and operation size, repeated calibration and maintenance costs associated with their placement in high-temperature variability, and corrosive environments are significant and beyond the affordability and sustainability limits of small and medium size farms and even of commercial operators. As a more affordable alternative to direct weighing approaches, indirect approaches have been developed based on observed or inferred relationships between biometric and morphometric measurements of livestock and their BW. Initial indirect approaches involved manual measurements of animals using measuring tapes and tubes and the use of regression equations able to correlate such measurements with BW. While such approaches have good BW prediction accuracies, they are time consuming, require trained and skilled farm laborers, and can be stressful for both animals and handlers especially when repeated daily. With the concomitant advancement of contactless electro-optical sensors (e.g., 2D, 3D, infrared cameras), computer vision (CV) technologies, and artificial intelligence fields such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), 2D and 3D images have started to be used as biometric and morphometric proxies for BW estimations. This manuscript provides a review of CV-based and ML/DL-based BW prediction methods and discusses their strengths, weaknesses, and industry applicability potential.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhuoyi"},{"family":"Shadpour","given":"Saeed"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Esther"},{"family":"Rotondo","given":"Vanessa"},{"family":"Wood","given":"Katharine M"},{"family":"Tulpan","given":"Dan"}],"citation-key":"wang2021","container-title":"Journal of Animal Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Animal Science","DOI":"10.1093/jas/skab022","ISSN":"1525-3163","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,1]]},"page":"skab022","source":"Silverchair","title":"ASAS-NANP SYMPOSIUM: Applications of machine learning for livestock body weight prediction from digital images","title-short":"ASAS-NANP SYMPOSIUM","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/skab022","volume":"99"},

The total mixed ration (555 g kg−1 FW) was ensiled with six treatments: (1) no additives (control); (2) calcium propionate (CAP; 0.5% FW); (3) potassium sorbate (POS; 0.1% FW); (4) sodium diacetate (SDA; 0.5% FW); (5) Lactobacillus buchneri (LB; 1 × 106 cfu g−1 FW); and (6) Lactobacillus casei (LAC; 1 × 106 cfu g−1 FW). All silos (20 L) were opened for the fermentation profile and in vitro digestibility analysis after 95 days of fermentation, and then subjected to an aerobic stability experiment for 14 days. All the TMR silage was well preserved with a low pH (4.32~4.51), acceptable levels of butyric acid (1.34~1.56 g kg−1 dry matter), and ammonia nitrogen (69.1~87.1 g kg−1 total nitrogen). All the groups were steady during aerobic exposure, while the SDA treatment was more stable with lower populations of undesirable microorganisms on day 14. The CAP, POS, and SDA treatments evidently (p < 0.05) enhanced the in vitro digestibility of dry matter (54.8~57.5 vs. 48.4%) and neutral detergent fiber (48.4~51.6 vs. 41.1%) compared to the control. By comprehensive consideration, SDA is recommended as additive to enhance fermentation quality, aerobic stability, and in vitro digestibility of TMR silage containing 10% FW of WHDG.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Siran"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Haopeng"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Zhihao"},{"family":"Li","given":"Junfeng"},{"family":"Shao","given":"Tao"}],"citation-key":"wang2023","container-title":"Agronomy","DOI":"10.3390/agronomy13030672","ISSN":"2073-4395","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"3","page":"672","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Influences of Organic Acid Salts and Bacterial Additives on Fermentation Profile, Aerobic Stability, and In Vitro Digestibility of Total Mixed Ration Silage Prepared with Wet Hulless Barley Distillers’ Grains","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/13/3/672","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"wang2024","abstract":"Aging reduces the nutritional value of corn grain, which may be improved by fermentation prior to use. This study investigated the effects of replacing conventional corn (CC) with aging corn (AC) and fermented aging corn (FAC) in the diets of lactating Holstein cows. Six healthy third-parity Holstein cows were used in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square experiment with 21-day periods. Cows were fed twice and milked twice daily. The cows were randomly divided into three treatment groups: (1) CC diet: a diet with 23.6% starch in diet DM containing 24.0% conventional corn; (2) AC diet: a diet with 23.5% starch in diet DM containing 24.0% aging corn replacing conventional corn; and (3) FAC diet: a diet with 23.2% starch in diet DM containing 24.6% fermented aging corn replacing conventional corn. The diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous and contained identical roughage. The FAC treatment increased the starch digestibility compared with AC. Feeding FAC increased the concentrations of total volatile fatty acid compared with CC and AC and decreased the molar proportion of acetate compared with AC. At the family level, the relative abundance of Prevotellaceae was higher on FAC than CC. The relative abundance of Succinivibrionaceae was lower on FAC than on CC and AC. Besides, at the genera level, the relative abundance of Succinivibrionaceae_UCG_002 in the rumen was higher on AC than CC and FAC. The relative abundance of Prevotella and Ruminococcus was higher on FAC than CC and AC. The relative abundance of Succinivibrionaceae_UCG_001 was lower on FAC than CC. The Simpson index was lower on FAC than CC and AC. The FAC treatment increased the milk yield (34.0, 33.7, and 35.2 kg/d for CC, AC, and FAC group, respectively) and protein yield, and thus, energy-corrected milk production was increased, and at the same time, decreased the somatic cell score compared with CC and AC. The AC treatment increased the malondialdehyde concentration in plasma compared with CC and FAC. The concentrations in plasma of triglyceride and malondialdehyde were lower on FAC than AC. The immunoglobulin G concentration in plasma was higher on FAC than CC and AC. Overall, feeding AC resulted in decreased plasma antioxidant capacity compared with CC, whereas feeding FAC altered the relative abundance of bacteria in the rumen and improved starch digestibility, ruminal bacterial diversity, lactation performance, plasma antioxidant capacity and immune competence compared with AC in dairy cows.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"X.

  {"id":"Weatherly2018","abstract":"The objective of this study was to determine the effects of 2 different adsorbents (AD) composed of yeast fractions and bentonite (AD1 and AD2) during an aflatoxin (AF) challenge on the health and performance of lactating dairy cows. Lactating Holstein cows [(n = 76); BW (mean ± SD) = 698 ± 72 kg; DIM = 153 ± 83 d] were assigned to 1 of 5 treatments in a randomized complete block design. The trial lasted 28 d and measurements were made from d 22 to 28. From d 22 to 24 cows received an AF challenge (100 μg of AFB1/kg of diet DM administered orally). Treatments were: control (CON), no AD or AF; positive control (POS), no AD plus AF challenge; 30 g per cow per day of AD1 and AF challenge (P30); 60 g per cow per day of AD1 and AF challenge (P60); and 60 g per cow per day of AD2 and AF challenge (PROT). The appearance and disappearance of AF excreted in milk was tested at each milking from d 22 to 28 using SNAP tests (SNP; IDEXX, Inc.). Blood was sampled on d 22 and 26 (n = 2 per cow), and analyzed for superoxide dismutase (SOD) concentration. Milk samples from d 22 to 26 were analyzed for AFM1concentrations by HPLC. Fecal samples collected from the rectum on d 22 and 24 were analyzed for AFB1concentrations via HPLC. Statistical analysis was performed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. A quadratic treatment effect (P < 0.001) was observed for plasma SOD concentrations at 2.77, 1.99, and 1.97 ± 0.05 U/mL for POS, AD30, and AD60 treatments, respectively. Aflatoxin M1transfer (11.4 and 0.00 ± 1.60 g/kg), excretion (29.52 and 0.00 ± 4.58 μg/d), and concentrations in milk (0.76 and 0.00 ± 0.16 μg/kg) were greater for POS than CON, respectively (P < 0.001) but no differences were observed among other treatments. A tendency for a quadratic treatment effect (P = 0.08) was observed for fecal AFB1concentrations at 6.78, 8.55, and 5.07 ± 1.17 μg/kg for the POS, P30, and P60 treatments, respectively. Oral supplementation of yeast and bentonite clay-based adsorbents during an AF challenge resulted in quadratic changes in plasma SOD and fecal AFB1concentrations; however, no differences were observed for DMI or milk yield. In conclusion, yeast cell wall and bentonite-based adsorbent may be beneficial in reducing inflammation during an AF challenge but there were no treatment differences regarding its adsorbent capacity.","author":[{"family":"Weatherly","given":"M.

  {"id":"Weaver2000","abstract":"Passive transfer of colostral immunoglobulins has long been accepted as imperative to optimal calf health. Many factors, including timing of colostrum ingestion, the method and volume of colostrum administration, the immunoglobulin concentration of the colostrum ingested, and the age of the dam have been implicated in affecting the optimization of absorption. The practice of colostrum pooling, the breed and presence of the dam, and the presence of respiratory acidosis in the calf also may affect passive transfer. Various tests have been reported to accurately measure passive transfer status in neonatal calves. The radial immunodiffusion and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are the only tests that directly measure serum IgG concentration. All other available tests including serum total solids by refractometry, sodium sulfite turbidity test, zinc sulfate turbidity test, serum gamma-glutamyl transferase activity, and whole blood glutaraldehyde gelation estimate serum IgG concentration based on concentration of total globulins or other proteins whose passive transfer is statistically associated with that of IgG. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature of passive transfer in calves including factors that affect passive transfer status, testing modalities, effects of failure of passive transfer on baseline mortality, consequences of failure of passive transfer, and some treatment options. Many previously accepted truisms regarding passive transfer in calves should be rejected based on the results of recent research.","author":[{"family":"Weaver","given":"Dusty M."},{"family":"Tyler","given":"Jeff W."},{"family":"VanMetre","given":"David C."},{"family":"Hostetler","given":"Douglas E."},{"family":"Barrington","given":"George M."}],"citation-key":"Weaver2000","container-title":"Journal of veterinary internal medicine / American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine","DOI":"10.1111/j.1939-1676.2000.tb02278.x","ISBN":"0891-6640 (Print)\\n0891-6640 (Linking)","ISSN":"08916640","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]},"page":"569-577","PMID":"11110376","title":"Passive transfer of colostral immunoglobulins in calves","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"Weinberg2004","abstract":"Many studies have shown the beneficial effects on ruminant performance of feeding them with silages inoculated with lactic acid bacteria (LAB). These benefits might derive from probiotic effects. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether LAB included in inoculants for silage can survive in rumen fluid (RF), as the first step in studying their probiotic effects. Experiments were conducted in the United States and Israel with clarified (CRF) and strained RF (SRF) that were inoculated at 10(6)-10(8) microorganisms/mL with and without glucose at 5 g/L. RF with no inoculants served as control. Ten commercial inoculants were used. The RF was incubated at 39 degrees C and sampled in duplicates at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h for pH and LAB counts. The results indicate that with glucose the pH of the RF decreased during the incubation period. In the SRF, the pH of the inoculated samples was higher than that of the controls in most cases. This might be a clue to the mechanism by which LAB elicit the enhancement in animal performance. LAB counts revealed that the inoculants survived in the RF during the incubation period. The addition of glucose resulted in higher LAB counts.","author":[{"family":"Weinberg","given":"Zwi G"},{"family":"Muck","given":"Richard E"},{"family":"Weimer","given":"Paul J"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yaira"},{"family":"Gamburg","given":"Mira"}],"citation-key":"Weinberg2004","container-title":"Applied biochemistry and biotechnology","ISSN":"0273-2289","issue":"1-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"page":"1-9","PMID":"15304734","title":"Lactic acid bacteria used in inoculants for silage as probiotics for ruminants.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15304734","volume":"118"},

  {"id":"weiss2002","abstract":"In 2001, the 7th Revised Edition of the Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle was published (NRC, 2001). A major goal of the subcommittee was to make the energy system used in the new NRC (2001) balanced, i.e., energy supply should equal energy output. Reviews of the 1989 NRC (NRC, 1989) system found that energy intake (concentration of energy in feed times dry matter intake) was 5 to 7% greater than energy expenditures (Vermorel and Coulon, 1998; Weiss, 1998). Because both papers suggested the error was more likely related to energy supply than energy requirements, the NRC (2001) completely changed the approach used to obtain feed energy values. The 2001 NRC also includes updated equations to estimate energy requirements of dairy cattle. This paper will provide an overview of the new NRC energy system and will discuss how these changes might affect diet formulation strategies and diet evaluation. The necessary equations can be found in NRC (2001) and will not be discussed in detail in this paper. Changes were made for all classes of dairy cattle (calves, growing heifers, lactating and dry cows), however, this paper will emphasize lactating cows.","author":[{"family":"Weiss","given":"W.P."}],"citation-key":"weiss2002","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"page":"1-13","title":"Overview and application of the 2001 nrc energy system 1","type":"report"},

Holstein cows were fed a control diet [2.9% of dry matter (DM) as long-chain fatty acids] or 1 of 3 diets with 3% added fatty acids (that mainly replaced starch). The 3 fat supplements were (1) mostly saturated (C18:0) free fatty acids (SFA), (2) Ca-salts of fatty acids (CaFA), and (3) triacylglyceride high in C16:0 fatty acids (TAG). Cows fed CaFA (22.8 kg/d) consumed less DM than cows fed the control (23.6 kg/d) and TAG (23.8 kg/d) diets but similar to cows fed SFA (23.2 kg/d). Cows fed fat produced more fat-corrected milk than cows fed the control diet (38.2 vs. 41.1 kg/d), mostly because of increased milk fat percentage. No differences in yields of milk or milk components were observed among the fat-supplemented diets. Digestibility of DM, energy, carbohydrate fractions, and protein did not differ between diets. Digestibility of long-chain fatty acids was greatest for the CaFA diet (76.3%), intermediate for the control and SFA diets (70.3%), and least for the TAG diet (63.3%). Fat-supplemented diets had more DE (2.93 Mcal/kg) than the control diet (2.83 Mcal/kg), and DE intake by cows fed supplemented diets was 1.6 Mcal/d greater than by cows fed the control, but no differences were observed among the supplements. Because the inclusion rate of supplemental fats is typically low, large differences in fatty acid digestibility may not translate into altered DE intake because of small differences in DM intake or digestibility of other nutrients.","author":[{"family":"Weiss","given":"W P"},{"family":"Pinos-Rodríguez","given":"J M"},{"family":"Wyatt","given":"D J"}],"citation-key":"Weiss2011","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2010-3745","ISBN":"0022-0302","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"page":"931-939","PMID":"21257061","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"The value of different fat supplements as sources of digestible energy for lactating dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2010-3745","volume":"94"},
  {"id":"weiss2016","abstract":"Ensiling conditions strongly influence fermentation characteristics, yeast count, and aerobic stability. Numerous volatile organic compounds including esters are produced, which may negatively affect feed intake and animal performance and air quality. In addition to a farm survey, 3 laboratory experiments were carried out to study the effects of air (by delayed sealing or by air infiltration during anaerobic storage), temperature (20 and 35°C), and various types of additives [blends of either sodium benzoate and sodium propionate (SBSP) or of sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate (SBPS); buffered mixture of formic and propionic acids (FAPA); homofermentative inoculant (LAB)]. After additive treatment, chopped whole corn plants were packed into 1.5-L glass jars and stored for several months. For treatments with air infiltration, glass jars with holes in the lid and body were used. The farm survey in 2009 revealed large variation in lactate, acetate, ethanol, n-propanol, and 1,2-propanediol concentrations. Whereas ethyl esters were detected in all silages, the mean ethyl lactate concentrations were higher than those for ethyl acetate (474 vs. 38mg/kg of dry matter). In the ensiling experiments, few unequivocal effects of the tested factors on the analyzed parameters were observed due to many interactions. Delayed ensiling without additives decreased lactic acid production but, in one trial, increased acetic acid and had no effect on ethanol. The effect of delayed sealing on yeast counts and aerobic stability differed widely among experiments. Air infiltration during fermentation tested in one trial did not alter lactic acid production, but resulted in more acetic acid in delayed and more ethanol than in promptly sealed untreated silages. Greater ethanol production was associated with increased yeast numbers. Storage at high temperature resulted in lower lactic acid and n-propanol, and a trend toward reduced ethanol production was observed. The additive FAPA consistently caused increased ethanol and reduced n-propanol levels with no effect on yeast counts and aerobic stability. When the additives SBSP and SBPS decreased n-propanol and ethanol, reduced yeast counts were also found. Ethyl ester formation was strongly correlated with those of ethanol and to a lesser degree with those of the respective acid.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Weiss","given":"K."},{"family":"Kroschewski","given":"B."},{"family":"Auerbach","given":"H."}],"citation-key":"weiss2016","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2015-10323","ISSN":"0022-0302","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",10,1]]},"page":"8053-8069","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Effects of air exposure, temperature and additives on fermentation characteristics, yeast count, aerobic stability and volatile organic compounds in corn silage","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030216304842","volume":"99"},

Because of the individual and seasonal variability in colostrum yield and composition, maintaining an adequate supply of high-quality colostrum year-round remains a challenge for commercial dairy producers. In this narrative review, we described the individual, seasonal, and herd-level variability of colostrum production and summarized the association between individual animal factors such as parity, sex of the calf, calf birth weight, as well as indicators of the cow’s metabolic status and the yield and composition of colostrum. Further, we reviewed the current knowledge on the influence of prepartum nutrition and management strategies on colostrum production. Research on the metabolizable energy and protein supplied in the prepartum diet as well as into the inclusion and source of vitamins, minerals, and feed additives suggests prepartum nutrition influences the yield, quality, and composition of colostrum. Furthermore, the prepartum environment and dry period length remain influential factors in the production of colostrum. However, additional research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which prepartum nutrition and management affects colostrum production. Lastly, time to colostrum harvest and oxytocin administration as well as the current knowledge on the effect of heat-treatment and colostrum storage strategies on colostral components were discussed. To conclude, we identify critical gaps in knowledge for future focus of investigation in colostrum research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Westhoff","given":"T.A."},{"family":"Borchardt","given":"S."},{"family":"Mann","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"westhoff2024","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","container-title-short":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2023-24349","ISSN":"00220302","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1]]},"language":"en","page":"S0022030224000341","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"INVITED REVIEW: Nutritional and management factors that influence colostrum production and composition in dairy cows","title-short":"INVITED REVIEW","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030224000341"},

  {"id":"williamsonReducingMilkingFrequency2022","abstract":"This randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of temporarily reducing milking frequency (MF) on the resolution of ketosis and milk production in dairy cows in early lactation. To detect ketosis [blood β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) ≥1.2 mmol/L], Holstein cows were screened daily from 3 to 16 d in milk using a cow-side meter. Cows diagnosed with ketosis (n = 104) were randomly assigned to twice-daily milking (TDM) or reduced to once-daily milking (ODM) for 2 wk, then returned to twice-daily milking. Both treatment groups received a 5-d treatment of an oral propylene glycol drench (PG; 300 g) beginning on the afternoon of the diagnosis; cows received additional 5-d PG treatments if they had a ketotic test result (blood BHB ≥1.2 mmol/L) at least 4 d after finishing the first PG treatment. Blood BHB tests were conducted for the first 3 d after ketosis diagnosis, and then once every 3 d for 21 d of trial (DOT). Milk and milk component data were collected weekly for 15 wk following trial enrollment. The ODM group showed rapidly and markedly decreased blood BHB concentrations (primiparous cows: 1 DOT, 0.92 ODM vs. 1.22 TDM, 15 DOT, 0.55 vs. 0.81 mmol/L; multiparous cows: 1 DOT, 1.01 vs. 1.40, 15 DOT, 0.78 vs. 1.65 mmol/L). In addition, a logistic regression model indicated that ODM cows were less likely to have blood BHB concentrations ≥1.2 mmol/L [primiparous cows: 3 DOT: ODM 1% (95% confidence interval: 0-10%) vs. TDM 43% (30-58%), 15 DOT ODM 0% (0-0.2%) vs. TDM 22% (13-36%); multiparous cows: 3 DOT: ODM 33% (24-44%) vs. TDM 59% (48-69%), 15 DOT ODM 20.9% (13-31%) vs. TDM 64% (53-74%)]. The proportion of ODM cows that required additional treatments of PG were substantially lower than the TDM group (ODM: 39%; TDM: 64%) than the TDM cows during the initial 21-d period. However, during the 2-wk treatment period, cows in the ODM group produced 26% less milk and 25% less energy-corrected milk than the TDM cows. During wk 3 to 15, when all cows were milked twice daily, ODM cows produced less milk (−14%) and energy corrected milk (−12%) compared with the TDM group. Milk protein percentage was greater, and milk fat percentage and linear score tended to be greater in the ODM group over 15 wk. In conclusion, a 2-wk reduction of MF in ketotic cows from twice to once daily with treatment with PG resolved ketosis and decreased blood BHB concentrations more effectively than treating TDM cows with PG alone. However, the 2-wk MF reduction had immediate and long-term (up to 13 wk after cessation of MF reduction) negative effects on milk production.","author":[{"family":"Williamson","given":"M"},{"family":"Coute Serrenho","given":"R"},{"family":"M.C.

At parturition, cows were blocked by calving sequence and calcemic status as either normocalcemic (cutoff threshold of iCa ≥1.10 mmol/L) or hypocalcemic (cutoff threshold of iCa <1.10 mmol/L). Cows in each block were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: either an oral source of Ca (Ca-Oral; n = 12) or an intravenous source of Ca (Ca-IV; n = 12). Cows in the Ca-Oral group were offered a 20-L commercial Ca suspension (48 g of Ca) for voluntary consumption. The supplement contained Ca carbonate, Ca formate, Ca propionate, and other minerals and vitamins (Farm-O-San Reviva, Trouw Nutrition, Amersfoort, the Netherlands). Cows in the Ca-IV group received a 450-mL intravenous Ca solution (13 g of Ca) that contained 298 mg/mL of Ca gluconate, 33 mg/mL of magnesium chloride, and 82 mg/mL of boric acid (AmosCAL, Kommer-Biopharm BV, Heiloo, the Netherlands). Both treatments were initiated within 25 ± 10 min after calving. The oral Ca suspension was offered to cows in a 25-L bucket and was available for 10 min. All cows in the Ca-Oral group voluntarily consumed the entire 20 L of the Ca suspension within 5 min. Blood samples for Ca analyses were collected at 0 (before treatment initiation), 1, 3, 10, and 18 h relative to treatment, and at 0700 and 1900 h for the next 2 consecutive days, to represent the 24-, 36-, 48-, and 60-h sampling time points. In Ca-IV cows, both iCa and tCa concentrations peaked at 1 h (1.54 mmol/L for iCa and 2.85 mmol/L for tCa) and declined to a nadir at 24 h following treatment initiation (0.94 mmol/L for iCa and 1.74 mmol/L for tCa). Although whole-blood iCa and serum tCa were higher at 1 and 3 h in Ca-IV cows, concentrations of iCa were greater for Ca-Oral cows at 18, 24, and 36 h and for tCa at 24 and 36 h. Our data indicate that intravenous Ca infusion immediately induced a state of hypercalcemia followed by lower whole-blood iCa and serum tCa concentrations 24 h later compared with oral Ca.","author":[{"family":"Wilms","given":"Juliette"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Guanlin"},{"family":"Doelman","given":"John"},{"family":"Jacobs","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Martín-Tereso","given":"Javier"}],"citation-key":"Wilms2019","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2018-15754","ISSN":"15253198","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"6056-6064","PMID":"31079910","title":"Intravenous calcium infusion in a calving protocol disrupts calcium homeostasis compared with an oral calcium supplement","type":"article-journal","volume":"102"},
  {"id":"wilms2022","abstract":"The form of oral calcium (Ca) supplement and the Ca source influence Ca absorption dynamics resulting in different postpartum calcemia. The objective of this study was to investigate whether an oral Ca supplement (mainly CaCO3) offered for voluntary consumption would maintain or increase postpartum blood Ca to the same degree as a Ca bolus (mainly CaCl2) providing an equivalent dose of a Ca. A total of 72 Holstein cows were blocked by expected parturition date and parity. Within each block of 3 animals, cows were randomly assigned to one of three treatments, including an oral Ca supplement offered for voluntary consumption (Ca-drink, n = 23), an oral Ca bolus (Ca-bolus, n = 24), or an untreated group (CON, n = 25). Treatments were administered once within 15 min postpartum. The Ca-drink provided 45 g of Ca (CaCO3 source) and was mixed in 20 L of lukewarm water and offered to cows for 30 min. The Ca-bolus provided 43 g of Ca (71% from CaCl2 and 29% from CaSO4) and was administered once. Both Ca-bolus and CON cows received 20-l of lukewarm water at parturition to standardize the volume of fluids (Ca-drink or 20-l lukewarm water) offered at parturition. Dairy cows offered Ca-drink had a 28% higher fluid consumption than Ca-bolus and CON cows. Milk yield and milk composition expressed in percentage protein, fat, lactose, and urea did not differ, whilst there was a small but significant increase in DMI in cows receiving the Ca-drink compared to CON, while Ca-bolus did not differ from other groups. This was consistent with reduced BW losses between week 1 and 3 in cows receiving the Ca-drink suspension. Treatment by time interactions were present for blood Ca, glucose, and urea concentrations. Blood Ca was relatively stable in Ca-drink cows, while higher fluctuations were observed in Ca-bolus cows. In Ca-bolus cows, blood Ca increased from 15 min to 6 h, decreased from 6 to 24 h, and finally increased again from 24 to 48 h. At 24 h post administration, blood Ca was greater in cows receiving the Ca-drink than cows receiving the Ca-bolus. Blood glucose was greater in Ca-bolus cows at 15 min after treatment administration compared with Ca-bolus and CON, while blood urea was higher in CON than Ca-drink and Ca-bolus throughout the sampling period. These results indicate that voluntary oral Ca resulted in a relatively stable calcemia, whereas higher fluctuations were observed in cows receiving the Ca-bolus. Due to a lack of differences between Ca-drink and Ca-bolus compared with CON, it is not possible to conclude regarding the efficacy in maintaining postpartum blood Ca.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilms","given":"Juliette N."},{"family":"Daniel","given":"Jean-Baptiste"},{"family":"Martín-Tereso","given":"Javier"},{"family":"Klop","given":"Arie"},{"family":"Goselink","given":"Roselinde"},{"family":"Han","given":"Yanming"},{"family":"Kuijk","given":"Sandra","dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"wilms2022","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Research","DOI":"10.1017/S002202992200019X","ISSN":"0022-0299, 1469-7629","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2]]},"language":"en","page":"29-36","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Blood calcium dynamics in cows receiving an aqueous calcium suspension for voluntary consumption or a calcium bolus following parturition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-dairy-research/article/blood-calcium-dynamics-in-cows-receiving-an-aqueous-calcium-suspension-for-voluntary-consumption-or-a-calcium-bolus-following-parturition/A53C4ED2DB7E84F9FF3769DF775E3F35","volume":"89"},

  {"id":"Wilson2007","abstract":"Holstein dairy cows (four J5 vaccinates and four controls) selected for no recorded intramammary disease and low somatic cell count (SCC) during the previous lactation were challenged by intramammary infusion of Escherichia coli. Vaccination with J5 was at 8 weeks and again 4 weeks before the anticipated calving date. Cows were challenged at 8 to 16 days in milk (DIM). Shedding of E. coli in milk was significantly higher among controls than vaccinates (no shedding) from 6 h to 21 h postchallenge. From 21 h to 132 h postchallenge, SCC in challenged quarters of controls (5,429,000/ml) was significantly higher than that of vaccinates (490,000/ml). On the day after challenge, milk production in control cows was 8 kg less, while vaccinates gained 0.5 kg, a significant difference. In serum immediately prior to challenge, J5-specific immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) was significantly higher, IgG2 was nearly significantly higher, and IgM was the same in J5 vaccinates relative to controls. Vaccinates had proportionally more IgG2 in serum postcalving and in the first 12 h following challenge and less IgG2 in milk 24 h after challenge than the controls, approaching statistical significance. The ratio of J5-specific IgG1 and IgG2 combined compared to IgM was significantly higher in vaccinates than in controls in prechallenge serum (ratios of 15.8 and 3.2, respectively) and milk (5.0 and 1.3, respectively). Cows with higher IgM titers in milk 12 h postchallenge produced significantly less milk. Vaccination with J5 was significantly associated with higher production of J5-specific IgG1 and IgG2 in early lactation, reduced SCC, faster clearance of E. coli from milk, and less milk production loss following intramammary challenge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"David J"},{"family":"Mallard","given":"Bonnie","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Burton","given":"Jeanne L"},{"family":"Schukken","given":"Ynte H"},{"family":"Gröhn","given":"Yrjo T"}],"citation-key":"Wilson2007","container-title":"Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI","DOI":"10.1128/CVI.00104-07","ISSN":"1556-6811","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",6]]},"page":"693-9","PMID":"17460115","title":"Milk and serum J5-specific antibody responses, milk production change, and clinical effects following intramammary Escherichia coli challenge for J5 vaccinate and control cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1951090&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract","volume":"14"},

However, although maternal effects were defined by quantitative geneticists well over half a century ago, there remains some confusion over exactly what phenomena should be characterized as maternal effects and, more importantly, why it matters and how they are defined. We suggest a definition of maternal effects as the causal influence of the maternal genotype or phenotype on the offspring phenotype. This definition differs from some definitions in that it treats maternal effects as a phenomenon, not as a statistical construct. The causal link to maternal genotype or phenotype is the critical component of this definition providing the link between maternal effects and evolutionary and ecological processes. We show why phenomena such as maternal cytoplasmic inheritance and genomic imprinting are distinct genetically from and have different evolutionary consequences than true maternal effects. We also argue that one should consider cases where the maternal effect is conditional on offspring genotype as a class of maternal effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Wolf","given":"Jason B"},{"family":"Wade","given":"Michael J"}],"citation-key":"Wolf2009","container-title":"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

  {"id":"wu2020","abstract":"This study was aimed to explore the comparative acidifying properties of 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio) butanoic acid (HMTBA) and a combination of DL-methionine (DLM) and acidifier in male broiler production. A total of 480 1-day-old broiler chicks were randomly divided into four treatments: A (low HMTBA, 0.057% HMTBA); B (low acidifier, 0.05% DLM + 0.057% acidifier); C (high HMTBA, 0.284% HMTBA); and D (high acidifier, 0.25% DLM + 0.284% acidifier). At 21 d, growth performance, chyme pH, digestive enzyme activities, and intestinal microflora were measured. The pH of crop, gizzard, and ileum contents was higher in the HMTBA treatment group than in DLM + acidifier treatment group. Furthermore, acidifier supplementation promoted growth of butyrate-producing bacteria such as Faecalibacterium, whereas high HMTBA (0.284%) inhibited the proliferation of acid-producing bacteria including Roseburia and Collinsella. The chymotrypsin activity was lower in the HMTBA group than in the DLM + acidifier group. In contrast, high-level HMTBA group showed higher average daily gain and average daily feed intake than the DLM + acidifier group. These results suggested that HMTBA work through different pathways with DLM plus acidifier.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Yuqin"},{"family":"Yin","given":"Xiaonan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Youli"},{"family":"Mahmood","given":"Tahir"},{"family":"Shahid","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Yin","given":"Dafei"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Jianmin"}],"citation-key":"wu2020","container-title":"Animal science journal = Nihon chikusan Gakkaiho","DOI":"10.1111/ASJ.13409","ISSN":"1740-0929","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,1]]},"PMID":"32524726","publisher":"Anim Sci J","title":"Effect of 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio) butanoic acid and acidifier on the performance, chyme pH, and microbiota of broilers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32524726/","volume":"91"},

  {"id":"Wu2021","abstract":"The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of sodium butyrate and sodium β-hydroxybutyrate on lactation and health of dairy cows fed a high-concentrate (HC) diet. Eighty mid-lactation dairy cows with an average milk yield of 33.75 ± 5.22 kg/d were randomly allocated to four groups (n = 20 per group) and were fed either a low-concentrate (LC) diet, a HC diet, the HC diet with 1% sodium butyrate (HCSB), or the HC diet with 1% sodium β-hydroxybutyrate (HCHB). The feeding trial lasted for 7 weeks, with a 2-week adaptation period and a 5-week measurement period, and the trial started from 96 ± 13 d in milk. Sodium butyrate supplementation delayed the decline in milk production and improved milk synthesis efficiency and milk fat content. Additionally, it decreased the proinflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins (APPs) in plasma, the leucocytes in blood, the somatic cell count (SCC) in milk, and the gene expression of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and proinflammatory cytokines in the mammary gland, due to decreasing the contents of bacterial cell wall components (lipopolysaccharide, LPS; peptidoglycan, PGN; and lipoteichoic acid, LTA) in the rumen and plasma, compared with the HC diet. Sodium β-hydroxybutyrate supplementation also improved milk yield, milk synthesis efficiency and milk fat content and partially reduced the adverse effects caused by the HC diet, but it had no effect on decreasing bacterial cell wall components in the rumen and plasma, compared with the HC diet. Collectively, both sodium butyrate and sodium β-hydroxybutyrate mitigated the negative effects of HC diet on lactation and health of dairy cows, with sodium butyrate being more effective than sodium β-hydroxybutyrate.","author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Yongjiang"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Yawang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Ruiming"},{"family":"He","given":"Tianle"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Guohao"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Ke"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Junhui"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Juncai"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Guozhong"}],"citation-key":"Wu2021","container-title":"Toxins","DOI":"10.3390/toxins13050352","ISSN":"20726651","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"1-16","PMID":"34069117","title":"Sodium butyrate more effectively mitigates the negative effects of high-concentrate diet in dairy cows than sodium β-hydroxybutyrate via reducing free bacterial cell wall components in rumen fluid and plasma","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"xie2020","abstract":"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the application of an inoculant and a preservative on the fermentation quality, in vitro digestibility, and aerobic stability of alfalfa silage-based fermented total mixed ration (TMR). The TMR was ensiled with (1) no additives (control), (2) Lactobacillus plantarum (LP), or (3) potassium sorbate (PS). The V-scores of all silages were higher than 80 points during the 30 days of ensiling. The addition of LP and PS had no effects on the in vitro parameters, such as in vitro digestibility and in vitro gas production (p > 0.05). LP-treated silage showed similar fermentation quality and comparable aerobic stability to the control (110 h). The LP only decreased the ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) content (p < 0.05) during ensiling. The PS significantly increased the pH of TMR silages (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the addition of PS improved the aerobic stability (>162 h) of TMR silage, indicated by the higher water-soluble carbohydrate content and lower NH3-N content in comparison with those in the control after aerobic exposure (p < 0.05). The improvement in fermentation quality is extremely small in terms of applying LP in TMR silage based on a large percentage of other silage ingredients. The PS is effective in conserving unpacked TMR silage and showed the potential to reduce the risk of ruminal acidosis in livestock.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Xie","given":"Yixiao"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Shengyang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wenqi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Musen"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Zhe"},{"family":"Bao","given":"Jinze"},{"family":"Jia","given":"Tingting"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Zhu"}],"citation-key":"xie2020","container-title":"Animals","DOI":"10.3390/ani10122229","ISSN":"2076-2615","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"12","page":"2229","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Effects of the Application of Lactobacillus plantarum Inoculant and Potassium Sorbate on the Fermentation Quality, In Vitro Digestibility and Aerobic Stability of Total Mixed Ration Silage Based on Alfalfa Silage","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/12/2229","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"Xing2007","abstract":"The problem of inferring haplotypes from genotypes of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is essential for the understanding of genetic variation within and among populations, with important applications to the genetic analysis of disease propensities and other complex traits. The problem can be formulated as a mixture model, where the mixture components correspond to the pool of haplotypes in the population. The size of this pool is unknown; indeed, knowing the size of the pool would correspond to knowing something significant about the genome and its history. Thus methods for fitting the genotype mixture must crucially address the problem of estimating a mixture with an unknown number of mixture components. In this paper we present a Bayesian approach to this problem based on a nonparametric prior known as the Dirichlet process. The model also incorporates a likelihood that captures statistical errors in the haplotype/genotype relationship trading off these errors against the size of the pool of haplotypes. We describe an algorithm based on Markov chain Monte Carlo for posterior inference in our model. The overall result is a flexible Bayesian method, referred to as DP-Haplotyper, that is reminiscent of parsimony methods in its preference for small haplotype pools. We further generalize the model to treat pedigree relationships (e.g., trios) between the population's genotypes. We apply DP-Haplotyper to the analysis of both simulated and real genotype data, and compare to extant methods.","author":[{"family":"Xing","given":"Eric P"},{"family":"Jordan","given":"Michael I"},{"family":"Sharan","given":"Roded"}],"citation-key":"Xing2007","container-title":"Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology","DOI":"10.1089/cmb.2006.0102","ISSN":"1066-5277","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",4]]},"page":"267-84","PMID":"17563311","title":"Bayesian haplotype inference via the Dirichlet process.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17563311","volume":"14"},

Forty dairy cows were grouped according to days in milk (33 ± 7 d; mean ± SD) and milk production (33.9 ± 3.1 kg) and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments: control (no additive), 20 μg of AFB1/kg of diet dry matter (AF), addition of Solis Mos at 0.25% of diet dry matter (SM), and MIX (AF + SM). The experiment lasted 9 wk, including an adaptation period during the first week. Dry matter intake, milk yield, and milk composition were measured on d 6 and 7 of each week. Milk AFM1, plasma biochemical parameters, and ruminal fermentation variables were analyzed on the last days of wk 1 and 9. No differences were observed in dry matter intake, milk yield, percentages of milk protein, milk fat, and lactose, and somatic cell counts across the treatments. Addition of adsorbent in the AFB1-contaminated diet significantly reduced the milk AFM1 concentrations (0.19 vs. 0.13 μg/kg) and transfer rates (1.38 vs. 0.89%). Dairy cows fed an AFB1-contaminated diet had lower superoxide dismutase activity, total antioxidant capacity, glutathione peroxidase, and levels of IgG and IgA, and higher levels of malondialdehyde in the plasma. Inclusion of Solis Mos in the diet increased the plasma superoxide dismutase activity, total antioxidant capacity, and IgG levels, and decreased the malondialdehyde level. Neither AFB1 nor Solis Mos affected the plasma levels of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, or IgM. Long-term inclusion of adsorbent Solis Mos in the diet did not affect lactation performance or liver function, but it reduced milk AFM1 concentrations and oxidative stress and improved the immunological condition and ruminal fermentation in lactating dairy cows exposed to long-term AFB1 challenge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Xiong","given":"J L"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Y M"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"H L"},{"family":"Liu","given":"J X"}],"citation-key":"xiongEffectsDietaryAdsorbent2018","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2018-14645","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,1]]},"page":"8944-8953","PMID":"30055921","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effects of dietary adsorbent on milk aflatoxin M1 content and the health of lactating dairy cows exposed to long-term aflatoxin B1 challenge.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30055921","volume":"101"},

  {"id":"Yasui2014","abstract":"Multiparous Holstein cows (n=60) were used to determine effects of supplementing hydroxy forms of Zn, Cu, and Mn compared with 2 other common supplementation strategies on oxidative metabolism, cytological endometritis, and performance of transition cows. After a 1-wk pretreatment period, cows were assigned randomly to 1 of 3 dietary treatments from 21d before expected calving through 84d postcalving. Dietary treatments administered by daily top-dressing included (1) inorganic sulfate forms of Zn, Cu, and Mn (ITM); (2) a blend (75:25) of sulfates and organic complexes of Zn, Cu, and Mn (ITM/OTM); and (3) hydroxy trace minerals (HTM) of Zn, Cu, and Mn. The resulting dietary concentrations of supplemental Zn, Cu, and Mn were similar among treatments and averaged 40, 10, and 27mg/kg, respectively, before calving and 59, 15, and 40mg/kg, respectively, after calving. Total concentrations of Zn, Cu, and Mn averaged 80, 16, and 62mg/kg during the prepartum period and 102, 23, and 75mg/kg, respectively, during the postpartum period. Overall, effects of treatment on milk yield and milk composition were not significant. Cows fed HTM during the prepartum period had higher body weight (BW) than those fed ITM during the prepartum period and had higher BW during the postpartum period than those fed the other treatments; however, BW change, body condition score, and body condition score change were not affected by treatment. Plasma total antioxidant capacity was lower in cows fed HTM than ITM but was not different from cows fed ITM/OTM. Cows fed HTM tended to have lower concentrations of plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances than those fed ITM during the whole study period, but plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were not different between HTM and ITM/OTM. Plasma haptoglobin was lower in cows fed HTM than ITM/OTM at 1wk postpartum. Endometrial cytology 7d postcalving and cytological endometritis as assessed on 1d between 40 and 60d postcalving was not affected by treatment. In conclusion, supplementation with HTM sources of Zn, Cu, and Mn modulated plasma variables related to oxidative metabolism compared with supplementation with ITM; however, HTM and ITM/OTM resulted in similar responses. Furthermore, the source of trace minerals did not affect performance or uterine health in this experiment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Yasui","given":"T"},{"family":"Ryan","given":"C M"},{"family":"Gilbert","given":"R O"},{"family":"Perryman","given":"K R"},{"family":"Overton","given":"T R"}],"citation-key":"Yasui2014","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2013-7331","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6]]},"page":"3728-38","PMID":"24731626","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effects of hydroxy trace minerals on oxidative metabolism, cytological endometritis, and performance of transition dairy cows.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24731626","volume":"97"},

The LMAA pretreatment enhanced the digestibility by cleaving cross-linkages between cell wall components, whereas the SAA pretreatment additionally improved the digestibility by efficiently removing a major portion of the lignin under mild reaction conditions without significant loss of carbohydrates.

Ruminal pH, ammonia N concentration, and total VFA concentration were similar among treatments. Molar percentages of ruminal isoacids were lower for cows fed a mixture of yeast and fungal culture than for cows fed yeast or fungal culture alone. Yeast culture increased ruminal OM and CP digestion and decreased OM and N flow to the duodenum. Fiber digestion in the rumen was similar among treatments. Fungal culture stimulated proteolytic and cellulolytic bacterial counts. Proteolytic bacterial counts were also stimulated by yeast culture.

  {"id":"Yu1998","abstract":"Five types of processed corn were compared to determine the effects of processing on lactational performance and nutrient digestibilities in dairy cows. Forty lactating Holstein cows averaging 160 +/- 60 d in milk were randomly divided into five groups on the basis of pretreatment milk yields and were fed diets containing 40% corn grain for 56 d. Treatments were 1) finely ground corn, 2) coarsely ground corn, 3) steam-flaked corn at a low density, 4) steam-flaked corn at a medium density, and 5) steam-rolled corn. Cows fed the diet containing steam-flaked corn at a medium density had a higher milk yield (37.1 kg/d) than did cows fed the diets containing coarsely ground corn, steam-flaked corn at a low density, or steam-rolled corn; cows fed the diet containing finely ground corn had an intermediate milk yield (35.5 kg/d). Efficiency of feed utilization was greater, and dry matter intake was lower, for cows fed the diet containing finely ground corn than for cows fed the other diets. The fat content of milk was higher for cows fed the diets containing coarsely ground corn and steam-rolled corn than for cows fed the diet containing steam-flaked corn at a medium density. Milk protein and SNF contents and yields of protein, lactose, and SNF did not differ among diets. Apparent starch digestibilities in the total digestive tract were lower for diets containing coarsely ground corn (87.4%) and steam-rolled corn (91.3%) than for the other diets (X = 96.3%). Milk yield was highest for cows fed the diet containing steam-flaked corn with a medium density.

Forty-eight individually fed Holstein cows (21 primiparous, 27 multiparous) were stratified by calving date in 12 blocks and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments within block. Treatments were control, CrPr (8mg/d of Cr, KemTRACE brand chromium propionate 0.04%, Kemin Industries Inc., Des Moines, IA), RPLM (10g/d lysine and 5g/d methionine intestinally available, from LysiPEARL and MetiPEARL, Kemin Industries Inc.), or CrPr plus RPLM. Treatments were fed for 35 d; blood plasma samples were collected ond 21 and 35 of treatment, and blood neutrophils were isolated from 24 cows for analysis of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) transcript abundance in the basal state and after 12h of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation. Tailhead subcutaneous adipose tissue samples were collected ond 35 for measurement of adipocyte size. Plasma glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, and glucagon concentrations were unaffected by treatments, whereas plasma insulin concentration was increased by RPLM. Basal TNFα transcript abundance in neutrophils was not affected by treatment, but basal IL-1β transcript abundance was decreased by RPLM and tended to be increased by CrPr. After LPS activation, CrPr increased neutrophil TNFα transcript abundance. In addition, RPLM×parity interactions were detected for both TNFα and IL-1β abundance after LPS activation, reflecting enhanced responses in primiparous cows and attenuated responses in multiparous cows supplemented with RPLM. Adipocyte size was not affected by treatment. Supplemental CrPr and RPLM had minimal effects on metabolism when fed for 35d near peak lactation but may modulate innate immune function in lactating dairy cows.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Yuan","given":"K"},{"family":"Vargas-Rodriguez","given":"C F"},{"family":"Mamedova","given":"L K"},{"family":"Muckey","given":"M B"},{"family":"Vaughn","given":"M","dropping-particle":"a"},{"family":"Burnett","given":"D D"},{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"J M"},{"family":"Titgemeyer","given":"E C"},{"family":"Griswold","given":"K E"},{"family":"Bradford","given":"B J"}],"citation-key":"Yuan2014","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2013-7770","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6]]},"page":"3822-31","PMID":"24731640","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effects of supplemental chromium propionate and rumen-protected amino acids on nutrient metabolism, neutrophil activation, and adipocyte size in dairy cows during peak lactation.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24731640","volume":"97"},

Multiparous Israeli-Holstein dry cows (n = 44) at 256 d of pregnancy were assigned to 2 treatments: (1) control cows were fed prepartum a dry-cow diet and postpartum a lactating-cow diet that consisted of 5.8% ether extracts; and (2) extruded flaxseed (EF) cows were supplemented prepartum with 1 kg of extruded flaxseed (7.9% dry matter)/cow per d, and postpartum were fed a diet containing 9.2% of the same supplement. The EF supplement was fed until 100 d in milk. On average, each pre- and postpartum EF cow consumed 160.9 and 376.2g of C18:3n-3/d, respectively. Postpartum dry matter intake was 3.8% higher in the EF cows. Milk production was 6.4% higher and fat content was 0.4% U lower in the EF group than in the controls, with no differences in fat and protein yields. Energy balance in the EF cows was more positive than in the controls; however, no differences were observed in concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids and glucose in plasma. Compared with controls, EF cows had greater proportions of C18:3n-3 in plasma and adipose tissue. The proportion of n-3 FA in milk fat was 3.7-fold higher in the EF cows, and the n-6:n-3 ratio was decreased from 8.3 in controls to 2.3 in the EF cows. Within-group tests revealed that the C18:3n-3 content in milk fat in the EF cows was negatively correlated with milk fat percentage (r = -0.91) and yield (r = -0.89). However, no decrease in de novo synthesis of less than 16-carbon FA was found in the EF group, whereas C16:0 yields were markedly decreased. It appears that the enrichment of C18:3n-3 in milk fat was limited to approximately 2%, and the potential for increasing this n-3 FA in milk is higher for cows with lower milk fat contents. In conclusion, feeding increased amounts of C18:3n-3 during the transition period enhanced dry matter intake postpartum, increased milk production, decreased milk fat content, and improved energy balance. Increased amounts of EF considerably influenced the FA profile of plasma, adipose tissue, and milk fat. However, the extent of C18:3n-3 enrichment in milk fat was limited and was negatively correlated with milk fat content and yield.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Zachut","given":"M"},{"family":"Arieli","given":"a"},{"family":"Lehrer","given":"H"},{"family":"Livshitz","given":"L"},{"family":"Yakoby","given":"S"},{"family":"Moallem","given":"U"}],"citation-key":"Zachut2010","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2010-3427","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",12]]},"page":"5877-89","PMID":"21094761","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Effects of increased supplementation of n-3 fatty acids to transition dairy cows on performance and fatty acid profile in plasma, adipose tissue, and milk fat.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21094761","volume":"93"},

A database of 64 papers meeting the selection criteria was developed evaluating postruminally infused dl-methionine (9 papers with 18 control diets and 35 treatment comparisons), 2-hydroxy-4-methylthio butanoic acid (HMTBa) provided as either a liquid or Ca salt form (17 papers with 34 control diets and 46 treatment comparisons), Mepron (Evonik Industries, Essen, Germany; 18 papers with 35 control diets and 42 treatment comparisons), and Smartamine (Adisseo Inc., Antony, France; 20 papers with 30 control diets and 39 treatment comparisons). Dietary ingredients and their accompanying nutritional compositions as described in the reports were entered into the Cornell-Penn-Miner software to model the diets and to predict nutrients that were not reported in the original publication. Data were analyzed using a weighted analysis of response to supplementation compared with the intraexperiment control, as well as through a regression analysis to changing dietary MP Met. Data included in the analysis were from experiments published between 1970 and 2011 with cows supplemented with between 3.5 and 67.9. g of Met or its equivalent from HMTBa. Cows supplemented with Smartamine consumed more, whereas cows supplemented with Mepron consumed less DM compared with controls. Milk yield did not significantly respond to Met supplementation, although it tended to increase for cows supplemented with HMTBa and Mepron. Milk protein yield was increased due to supplementation from all sources or from infusion, and protein concentration was greater for all supplements or infusion of dl-Met, except for cows supplemented with HMTBa. Irrespective of Met source, milk protein yield increased 2.23. g of protein/g of MP Met until reaching the breakpoint. Milk fat yield was increased for Mepron and HMTBa, whereas milk fat concentration was increased for infused dl-Met and for cows supplemented with HMTBa. Based on regression analysis, response of milk fat yield to Met supplementation was not different for infused dl-Met, Mepron, and Smartamine (1.87. g of fat/g of MP Met), whereas the response to HMTBa was significantly greater at 5.38. g of fat/g of MP Met.","author":[{"family":"Zanton","given":"G.

  {"id":"Zebeli2008","abstract":"The main objective of this study was to develop practical models to assess and predict the adequacy of dietary fiber in high-yielding dairy cows. We used quantitative methods to analyze relevant research data and critically evaluate and determine the responses of ruminal pH and production performance to different variables including physical, chemical, and starch-degrading characteristics of the diet. Further, extensive data were used to model the magnitude of ruminal pH fluctuations and determine the threshold for the development of subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA). Results of this study showed that to minimize the risk of SARA, the following events should be avoided: 1) a daily mean ruminal pH lower than 6.16, and 2) a time period in which ruminal pH is <5.8 for more than 5.24 h/d. As the content of physically effective neutral detergent fiber (peNDF) or the ratio between peNDF and rumen-degradable starch from grains in the diet increased up to 31.2 +/- 1.6% [dry matter (DM) basis] or 1.45 +/- 0.22, respectively, so did the daily mean ruminal pH, for which a asymptotic plateau was reached at a pH of 6.20 to 6.27. This study also showed that digestibility of fiber in the total tract depends on ruminal pH and outflow rate of digesta from reticulorumen; thereby both variables explained 62% of the variation of fiber digestibility. Feeding diets with peNDF content up to 31.9 +/- 1.97% (DM basis) slightly decreased DM intake and actual milk yield; however, 3.5% fat-corrected milk and milk fat yield were increased, resulting in greater milk energy efficiency. In conclusion, a level of about 30 to 33% peNDF in the diet may be considered generally optimal for minimizing the risk of SARA without impairing important production responses in high-yielding dairy cows. In terms of improvement of the accuracy to assessing dietary fiber adequacy, it is suggested that the content of peNDF required to stabilize ruminal pH and maintain milk fat content without compromising milk energy efficiency can be arranged based on grain or starch sources included in the diet, on feed intake level, and on days in milk of the cows.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Zebeli","given":"Q"},{"family":"Dijkstra","given":"J"},{"family":"Tafaj","given":"M"},{"family":"Steingass","given":"H"},{"family":"Ametaj","given":"B N"},{"family":"Drochner","given":"W"}],"citation-key":"Zebeli2008","container-title":"Journal of dairy science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2007-0572","ISSN":"1525-3198","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",5]]},"page":"2046-66","PMID":"18420634","title":"Modeling the adequacy of dietary fiber in dairy cows based on the responses of ruminal pH and milk fat production to composition of the diet.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18420634","volume":"91"},
  {"id":"Zebeli2009","abstract":"The main objective of this study was to evaluate correlative relationships between rumen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and mediators of acute phase response with milk fat yield and efficiency in dairy cows challenged with graded amounts of barley grain in the diet. An additional aim of the study was to quantify the intercow variation in relation to milk fat production and acute phase response in cows fed graded amounts of grain. Eight primiparous, lactating Holstein cows (60 d in milk) were assigned to 1 of the 4 total mixed rations containing barley grain at 0, 15, 30, and 45% (dry matter basis) in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square design. Free rumen LPS, plasma acute phase proteins, and milk fat content were quantified in multiple samples collected on d 5 and 7 of the measurement periods shortly before the morning feeding. Results showed markedly greater concentrations of rumen LPS with increasing dietary grain level. The correlative analysis revealed strong negative relationships between rumen LPS and milk fat content and yield. The predictor variable of rumen LPS explained 69% of the variation during the milk fat reduction of the cows. The stronger depression in milk fat percentage was obtained when rumen LPS exceeded a threshold of 5,564 ng/mL, corresponding to a milk fat content of 3.39%. The increase in concentration of rumen LPS was also associated with declines in milk fat yield and 3.5% fat-corrected milk (R(2) = 0.50), as well as milk energy efficiency (R(2) = 0.43). The correlative analysis also indicated that the increase of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) in response to higher grain feeding was associated with a linear decrease of milk fat content and yield (R(2) = 0.28 to 0.46). Furthermore, the statistical analysis revealed high percentages of intercow variation related to milk fat variables, as well as the responses of rumen LPS and plasma CRP. Taken together, the current results implicate rumen LPS and the host CRP response in the lowering of milk fat content and milk energy efficiency in dairy cows fed high-grain diets. Further research is warranted to understand the mechanism(s) by which rumen LPS and inflammatory responses to LPS lower milk fat synthesis and milk energy efficiency and to develop novel strategies for their prevention.","author":[{"family":"Zebeli","given":"Q."},{"family":"Ametaj","given":"B.N."}],"citation-key":"Zebeli2009","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2009-2178","ISBN":"1525-3198 (Electronic) 0022-0302 (Linking)","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"page":"3800-3809","PMID":"19620662","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Relationships between rumen lipopolysaccharide and mediators of inflammatory response with milk fat production and efficiency in dairy cows","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030209707027","volume":"92"},

Correlative relationships among variables were determined by linear and nonlinear regression procedures adjusted for the effects of day, animal, and experimental period. Increasing the amount of grain in the diet was successful in inducing an acute phase response, as assessed by augmentation of rumen endotoxin and plasma CRP and SAA (P < 0.01). The correlative analysis revealed inverse, nonlinear relationships of rumen endotoxin and plasma SAA with circulating Ca. Interestingly, plasma Ca reached the asymptotic plateau at 10.6 mg/dL. The increase in rumen endotoxin was associated with an abrupt decrease in plasma Fe (R(2) = 0.91; P < 0.001). A similar relationship, although at a reduced estimation accuracy (R(2) = 0.21; P < 0.01), was observed between rumen endotoxin and plasma Zn. Augmentation of rumen endotoxin and plasma CRP resulted in a positive, biphasic response of plasma Cu. In conclusion, the increase in rumen endotoxin in response to high-grain diets, and the resulting increases in plasma SAA and CRP, were strongly correlated with fluctuations of plasma minerals. Results suggest that new feeding strategies should be developed to curb the release of endotoxin in the rumen fluid to prevent perturbing minerals in the plasma.","author":[{"family":"Zebeli","given":"Q."},{"family":"Dunn","given":"S.

Eight cows were infused intravenously (i.v.) with 100mL of sterile saline and served as the control group (CON). The other 8 cows were infused i.v. with 100mL of sterile saline containing 3 increasing doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), from Escherichia coli O111:B4, for 3 consecutive weeks during the 2 wk before and 1 wk after parturition as follows: (1) 0.01mug of LPS/kg of body weight (BW) on d -14 and -10; (2) 0.05mug of LPS/kg of BW on d -7 and -3; and (3) 0.1mug of LPS/kg of BW on d 3 and 7 postpartum. Nine blood samples were collected during the experimental period (i.e., from -14 to 28 d postpartum) and analyzed for calcium, zinc, iron, copper, glucose, lactate, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), cholesterol, insulin, cortisol, serum amyloid A (SAA), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), haptoglobin (Hp), and anti-LPS IgA, IgG, and IgM. Results showed that intermittently induced endotoxemia decreased feed intake and milk production and triggered alterations in plasma cholesterol, BHBA, Hp, Ca, Cu, and anti-LPS IgG and IgM. All of these changes were associated with a greater number of cows affected by metabolic disorders such as left displaced abomasum (LDA, 2 from 8 LPS cows vs. 0 from 8 CON cows) and retained placenta (RP; 4 from 8 LPS cows vs. 0 from 8 CON cows). In addition, the discriminant analysis differently clustered the cow responses within LPS group, each corresponding to LDA, RP, and the cows displaying no clinical health problems (LPS-NO). The stepwise selection procedure of the best discriminant variables revealed that plasma Ca and anti-LPS IgG, as well as glucose and cortisol, were the best discriminating variables for cows affected by LDA, whereas NEFA and cholesterol better discriminated for cows affected by RP. This analysis also revealed that the cluster of plasma variables including plasma Cu, SAA, BHBA, and anti-LPS IgA were the best discrimination for the LPS-NO group.

  {"id":"Zhang2015","abstract":"Dietary methionine is indispensable for animal maintenance, growth and development. L-methionine (L-Met), and its synthetic forms DL-methionine (DL-Met) and 2-hydroxy-4 (methylthio) butanoic acid (HMTBA) are common supplemental methionine sources in animal diets. There are different characteristics for cellular absorption, transport, metabolism and bio-efficiency between these three dietary methionine sources. Moreover, there are differences in their utilization among various species such as chickens, pigs and ruminants. As a methionine precursor, HMTBA is efficacious in the promotion of growth in animals. It is absorbed mainly by monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), coupled with the activity of the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger (NHE3), while DL-Met uptake occurs via multiple carrier-mediated systems. Liver, kidney and small intestine can metabolize D-Met and HMTBA to L-Met through oxidation and transamination. In ruminants, the non-hepatic tissues act as major sites of HMTBA conversion, which are different from that in chickens and pigs. HMTBA also has additional benefits in anti-oxidation. Understanding the characteristics of uptake and metabolism of different methionine sources will greatly benefit the industry and bioscience research.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Shuai"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Eric A."},{"family":"Gilbert","given":"Elizabeth R."}],"citation-key":"Zhang2015","container-title":"Frontiers in Bioscience - Elite","DOI":"10.2741/e744","ISSN":"19450508","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"478-490","title":"Bioavailability of different dietary supplemental methionine sources in animals","type":"article-journal","volume":"7E"},
  {"id":"Zhang2017","abstract":"Supplementation of methionine (Met) may improve immunometabolic status, specifically during a period of inflammatory stress. The aim of the present study was to establish an inflammation model using primary neonatal bovine hepatocytes and to examine the effects of increasing concentrations of dl-Met and a maintained Met to lysine (Lys) ratio on hepatocyte inflammatory responses, antioxidant production, and Met metabolism during lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Hepatocytes isolated from 4 calves were maintained as monolayer cultures and exposed to 0, 10, or 40 µMdl-Met and 100 µM Lys (0Met100Lys, 10Met100Lys, or 40Met100Lys) or 10 µMdl-Met and 25 µM Lys (10Met25Lys). Cells were exposed to each treatment for 16 h and then challenged with either 0 or 100 ng/mL of LPS for 8 h. In the absence of LPS, glutathione (GSH) was not altered by 10Met100Lys or 10Met25Lys but was increased by 40Met100Lys. With LPS challenge, GSH concentration was decreased with 40Met100Lys and tended to be decreased with 10Met100Lys. Hepatocytes receiving 10Met100Lys treated with 100 ng/mL of LPS showed an inflammatory response with increased mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNFα), IL-6, IL-1β, and interferon gamma, which was accompanied by increased nuclear factor κB inhibitor and serum amyloid A3 mRNA. The treatment 40Met100Lys was effective for preventing the LPS-induced increase in expression of the above genes except TNFα. Similar preventative effects were observed for 10Met25Lys; however, it did not prevent the LPS-induced increase in TNFα or IL-6 mRNA. Lipopolysaccharide challenge decreased mRNA expression of key genes controlling the transmethylation and Met regeneration pathways, which was not prevented by Met supplementation. The data suggest that bovine hepatocyte cultures can be used as a biological model to study the inflammatory cascade via an LPS challenge. Supplementation of Met prevents the LPS-induced hepatocyte cytokine expression and is associated with elevated intracellular GSH concentration.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qian"},{"family":"White","given":"Heather M."}],"citation-key":"Zhang2017","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"10.3168/jds.2017-12932","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"8565-8577","PMID":"28755942","publisher":"American Dairy Science Association","title":"Regulation of inflammation, antioxidant production, and methyl-carbon metabolism during methionine supplementation in lipopolysaccharide-challenged neonatal bovine hepatocytes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030217307063","volume":"100"},
  {"id":"Zhang2018","abstract":"The objective of this study was to search for potential alterations in innate immunity reactants and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in the blood of transition dairy cows before, during, and after clinical occurrence of milk fever (MF) and identify potential predictive biomarkers of disease. One hundred pregnant multiparous Holstein dairy cows were involved in the study starting from − 8 wks before the expected day of parturition until + 8 wks postpartum as part of a large retrospective longitudinal study. Health status, DMI, milk yield, and milk composition were monitored during the whole experimental period. Six healthy cows (CON) and 6 cows that showed clinical signs of MF were selected for blood analyses. Serum concentrations of lactate, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), β-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), haptoglobin (Hp), and serum amyloid A (SAA) were determined. Results indicated that concentrations of serum lactate, IL-6, TNF, SAA, and Hp were greater in cows with MF than those in the CON group at different time points. Moreover, serum lactate, TNF, SAA, and Hp were greater in cows with MF starting at − 8 and − 4 wks prior to parturition. Both principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares - discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) showed separated clusters between MF and CON cows at − 8, − 4, and disease diagnosis weeks. Overall DMI and milk production were lower in MF-affected cows. Additionally milk fat and fat:protein ratio were greater in MF. In conclusion, cows affected by MF showed alterations in some of the innate immunity reactants and metabolites related to carbohydrate metabolism several weeks prior to appearance of clinical signs of MF. Variable importance in projection plots demonstrated that TNF and SAA in the serum were the strongest discriminators between MF cows and CON ones, which might be useful as predictive biomarkers of the disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Guanshi"},{"family":"Dervishi","given":"Elda"},{"family":"Ametaj","given":"Burim N."}],"citation-key":"Zhang2018","container-title":"Research in Veterinary Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.rvsc.2018.02.013","ISSN":"15322661","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,1]]},"page":"72-82","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","title":"Reprint of Milk fever in dairy cows is preceded by activation of innate immunity and alterations in carbohydrate metabolism prior to disease occurrence","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2017.12.008","volume":"116"},
  {"id":"zhang2020","abstract":"Ketosis, characterized by high concentrations of ketone bodies in the blood, urine, and milk, affects a considerable number of cows immediately after calving. Although much is known about ketosis, dairy cows continue to be affected in every herd world-wide. Cows affected by ketosis are treated with palliative treatments after the disease is diagnosed. This is a very expensive approach and costs the dairy industry extra expenses, contributing to lower profitability of dairy herds. In this review article, we summarize the mainstream view on ketosis, classification of ketosis into three types, current diagnostic approaches to ketosis, and the economic impact of ketosis on dairy farms. Additionally, we discuss the most recent applications of the new ‘omics’ science of metabolomics in studying the etiopathology of ketosis as well as its contribution in identification of novel screening or diagnostic biomarkers of ketosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Guanshi"},{"family":"Ametaj","given":"Burim N."}],"citation-key":"zhang2020","container-title":"Dairy","DOI":"10.3390/dairy1010005","ISSN":"2624-862X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"1","page":"42-60","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Ketosis an Old Story Under a New Approach","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2624-862X/1/1/5","volume":"1"},
  {"id":"Zhou2016","abstract":"The immunometabolic status of peripartal cows is altered due to changes in liver function, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Nutritional management during this physiological state can affect the biological components of immunometabolism. The objectives of this study were to measure concentrations of biomarkers in plasma, liver tissue, and milk, and also polymorphonuclear leukocyte function to assess the immunometabolic status of cows supplemented with rumen-protected methionine (Met) or choline (CHOL). Forty-eight multiparous Holstein cows were used in a randomized complete block design with 2×2 factorial arrangement of Met (Smartamine M, Adisseo NA, Alpharetta, GA) and CHOL (ReaShure, Balchem Inc., New Hampton, NY) level (with or without). Treatments (12 cows each) were control (CON), no Met or CHOL; CON and Met (SMA); CON and CHOL (REA); and CON and Met and CHOL (MIX). From −50 to −21d before expected calving, all cows received the same diet [1.40Mcal of net energy for lactation (NEL)/kg of DM] with no Met or CHOL. From −21d to calving, cows received the same close-up diet (1.52Mcal of NEL/kg of DM) and were assigned randomly to each treatment. From calving to 30d, cows were on the same postpartal diet (1.71Mcal of NEL/kg of DM) and continued to receive the same treatments until 30d. The Met supplementation was adjusted daily at 0.08% DM of diet, and CHOL was supplemented at 60g/cow per day. Liver (−10, 7, 21, and 30d) and blood (−10, 4, 8, 20, and 30d) samples were harvested for biomarker analyses. Neutrophil and monocyte phagocytosis and oxidative burst were assessed at d 1, 4, 14, and 28d. The Met-supplemented cows tended to have greater plasma paraoxonase. Greater plasma albumin and IL-6 as well as a tendency for lower haptoglobin were detected in Met- but not CHOL-supplemented cows. Similarly, cows fed Met compared with CHOL had greater concentrations of total and reduced glutathione (a potent intracellular antioxidant) in liver tissue. Upon a pathogen challenge in vitro, blood polymorphonuclear leukocyte phagocytosis capacity and oxidative burst activity were greater in Met-supplemented cows. Overall, liver and blood biomarker analyses revealed favorable changes in liver function, inflammation status, and immune response in Met-supplemented cows.","author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Z."},{"family":"Vailati-Riboni","given":"M."},{"family":"Trevisi","given":"E."},{"family":"Drackley","given":"J.K."},{"family":"Luchini","given":"D.N."},{"family":"Loor","given":"J.J."}],"citation-key":"Zhou2016","container-title":"Journal of Dairy Science","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-10525","ISSN":"00220302","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"8716-8732","PMID":"27638261","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Better postpartal performance in dairy cows supplemented with rumen-protected methionine compared with choline during the peripartal period","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022030216306245","volume":"99"},
